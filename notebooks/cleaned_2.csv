0,fun reinvention the pokémon formula hopefully the next version keeps this change while giving better look 
1,fun challenging times pokemon game with addictive gameplay loop and interesting system fighting and catching pokemon huge step the right direction the graphics performance and multiplayer options need work but those are the only major flaws the story pacing battles catching mechanics exploration and general gameplay are such improvement over sword shield and sun moon there are major series changes that make big differences quality life such limit the number moves pokemon can learn they just have memorized pre battles and not having trade evolve certain pokemon anymore using rare items them instead exploration crafting gathering and finding rare and shiny pokemon have never been this fun gone much the tedium and boredom found previous games you care only about graphics online competitive battles you will find reasons not like this game but you into the collecting aspect pokemon you will love this worth noting that the graphics and performance issues are much less noticeable when playing handheld 
2,best pokemon game all time new pokemon new stuff new ways catch pokemon and better gameplay 
3,one outstanding experience that certain absolutely love the direction gamefreak going for with this whole new installment for the pokemon series and very refreshing while being very needed the same time catching pokemon this game more fun than ever and fan since the first era with the firered leafgreen versions way more than nostalgia trip brand new experience and sincerely hope that will see bigger sequel because the game really deserves one with further gameplay enhancements maybe bigger map with more activities cheers all the haters 
4,incredible game that moves the pokemon series forward fresh new direction the gameplay loop fun and while the graphics aren great they are more than fine gameplay should always take precedent over graphics and legends arceus joy play 
5,addicted new mechanics and ideas are really fantastic can stop playing over hrs and still can put down the console the world really beautifull exploration truly amazing the only grip the performance and graphics but the game has own graphical moments must play for sure 
6,this such spectacular evolution for the pokémon franchise from the first few moments you know you stepping into new fresh take the series and the game continues surprise time and time again even into hours gameplay 
7,delight play this game perfect evolution the saga with magnificent exploration completing the pokedex very satisfying unlike traditional pokemon that was more nuisance than anything else graphically not bad all but that the least important fun addictive enjoy 
8,this the best pokémon game ever played feels like what thought was playing when was child years ago but without having imagine much 
9,get this out the way the graphics the only thing imho that needs polish but they are still servicable been playing the game for over hours and honestly most fun had years with pokemon game this game testing grounds for future pokemon games this style let put the graphics aside for moment and look the bigger picture here aside from graphics you want more pokemon games like this sure that why despite the graphics needing more that this game deserves 
10,excellent step the right direction for pokemon not listen the bad reviews they are weak and shall forgotten 
11,finally this the change the saga what the true consumers demanded hope the next generation with 1000 pokémon will full open world and the best gen all times 
12,game with terrible graphics and technical issues but extremely fun and addictive gameplay this the right direction for pokémon much more enjoyable than the boring exploration and battles and exploring crafting discovering new pokémon blast also the reviews are from people who obviously didn even bother playing the game and are just hating because looked bad the trailers and they don like wrong 
13,overall this game breath fresh air brings new elements and life system that has otherwise overstayed its welcome for the last few decades genuinely hope they keep this fusion rpg turn based system for pokemon games follow allowed the player actual choice and actual exploration that felt rewarding whether that the form finding rare items pokemon spawns never felt was pointless actually touch every corner the admittedly large segmented areas for player choice there were many times had marker the map which indicated where needed progress the story which just ignored you can explore catch and train pokemon your own pace which most pokemon fans know isn the norm you can find rare items pokemon alpha pokemon and everything else freely from your second time stepping into the fields which was really nice ontop that there are multiple ways completed your pokedex you can battle you can capture you can observe you can raise them yourself and learn things about them you see lot people here saying felt tedious but they had options they just didn explore them take the time read them course there graphical downside but honestly never felt like hindered experience throughout play through area they need work though going forward without going too much into since want this spoiler free review this game amazing can understand people who are trying say this the worse pokemon game ever exist far from the worse and easily ranks one the best imo really hope they intend keep this formula because don know can revert the old system gen9 after experiencing this this fun game and you actually read into the mechanics and into the side quest they give you fun idea the npcs take the world your character and many other aspects lot fun easter eggs are the game too keep your eyes peeled for those 
14,best pokemon everhistory 10gameplay 10ost 10art graphycs for funny 
15,the best pokemon game far the world feels immersive the gameplay fun and escapes the old formula which was getting stale after every game being near enough copy paste the last 
16,have played literally every pokémon game over the last years still remember sitting the car parents got and sister gameboy color and game for each pokemon red for sister pokemon blue for always had rival growing trying catch more train harder just over all the better pokémon trainer than sister she filled her dex before but had the first lvl 100 pokémon older now internet has definitely impacted personal connection the pokémon franchise because made feel less connected individuals but pokémon legends arceus brought the personal connection pokémon missed for long over the years yes love the old mechanics but after years them think time for fresh start and arceus did just that see this game gen whole new pokémon experience and feel like this game more fairly compared pokémon yellow first touch multiplayer since see most complaining the lack multiplayer but this game not game meant have all the fancy online features that take away the truest soul and heart pokémon the reason all attached the original games was the connection had with our pokémon and trading pokémon that feeling you get when companion you worked hard leaves your party you feel battles will coming but they need build the world for first arceus needs seen foundation for what can come and truly believe gamefreak sees the same way think about the game starts off with being sent into the past before gyms before pokémon centers before even people and pokémon achieved harmony the world isn empty just fertile and ready for civilization established jublife city just the start mechanic wise this game revolutionized how play pokémon being able run and throwing out your pokémon left and right gather material cycling through them you get rhythm and collecting even faster because you have your pokémon helping getting caught pokémon and throwing out yours just you can actually run away good distance away from the pokémon attacking you more hitting run away button for throwing all six your pokémon out they can interact with each other even running into the toward the enemy pokémon you tell your pokémon attack the mechanics let you interact with your pokémon many ways rating technically for this game but damn good start for the next generation pokémon 
17,the pokemon game been waiting for since first watched the anime kid visuals are little lacking but everything else amazing inflated battle the trolls 
18,been long time since picked pokemon game think alpha sapphire was the last one remember picking pokemon red and has come long way after playing this game all want now for them the remake the kanto region with all the original pokemon 
19,refreshing new take the series the ball catching mechanics are great and love the options the game gives graphics could better but the story also very good 
20,this new masterpiece brought the pokemon community try over the positive elements and things improve also try make free spoilers too but things improve you rated this game and has things work sure rating game based the fun having and the urge continue playing and both those things are over the roof having blast and the people around who bought too seems the same place this totally worth opinion giving this just because pokemon absolutely not pokemon the last few years has been hard finish the sense getting boring before you get the good part the end game lets start with the positives catching mecanics are really fun using items lure stun scare pokemon while having new pokeballs that play with distance and surprise blast even have every pokemon pokemon home this game enjoying catching everything see for the first time years trying catch pokemon surprise also really rewarding and fun overworld use pokemon being able chose which pokemon throw any time really interresting like preparing the right pokeball case something goes wrong when catching knowing pokemon certain type hidden somewhere and using the best pokemon uncover crafting and game economy meaningful the world full resources look for and the money has its uses you don hoard pokemon has been giving too much players the last few games the point where hard spend all pokedex feels like you really working not filling itslef its own with just encounter while good portion just fills itslef while playing normally often stop check the pokemon front see can work something the pokedex progression also the game progression and really feels like fun goal work combat some base elements makes more refreshing like status effect for example none them last forever anymore but they have some other effects like the new sleep drowsy that makes the pokemon receive more damage this makes such moves more interresting the previous game was running around with thunderwave pokemon and catching most stuff with that the strong and agile style are interresting combined with the combat timeline refreshing while staying close tradition ivs evs are gone replaced new system that simpler although didn mind the old system was bit tedious and getting redundant for welcome the change here breeding while first was shocked that was removed was boring portion the game opinion while wouldnt mind having back with bit rework feel the game better without for this iteration alpha pokemon really fun little challenges catch these everywhere love shiny hunting now fun this game gosh weird say that things work the story while good story for pokemon not feeling bored like previous recent games but not feeling like want rush know what next maybe for the better though because taken merry time explore and experience the world and that fun competitive they really need bring battle between players the future feels off not have that option and fun part the endgame build good team battle graphics not sure why many people complain here the graphics are even not par with games like breath the wild they are still pokemon has never been praised for its graphics the lightning seems off some places when rains but other than that totally fine battle with noble pokemon while like the general idea and having fun during these battles its little offsetting throw food into pokemon face calm down like hell would calm down you threw favorite food the face the idea fun play but weird concept inventory don mind moving things storage and managing inventory but surely some things can done help that process same for pokemon boxes guess feel miss couple things improve the usage both these 
21,100 adicted love pokemon played since gen1 but didnt enjoy the games since and now hooked the quests the new pokedex mechanics the pokemon roaming its all much fun for real giv try you wont regret 
22,this huge step for turn based rpgs its open world simple yet difficult times and for company that only really made hand held games huge step there negative here but come its fun fresh new turn based experiance that theory should get better 
23,was really dissapointed with every mainline pokemon game switch far let and bdsp were inferior versions frlg platinum imo and swsh really lacked when came exploring and content over all therefore can believe that gamefreak finally did again they finally made awesome pokemon game again the new catching mechanics huge areas explore interesting story terms pokemon game lot side stuff etc now that what call next level pokemon game graphics could better but they aren bad either close they can look really nice but the draw render distance that could better overall the best pokemon game since oras imo and every pokemon should definitely pick this game you won regret 
24,oops gamefreak did again been awhile since gamefreak released good pokemon game the last one pokemon emerald obvi holy arceus don know why took sooooo long for them release another masterpiece excited see this formula milked for the next decades thinks looking forward pokemon legends kyurem deoxys 
25,this finally the game should have got long time ago seamless battle great world explore bit freedom how you want tackle things this for the first real pokemon game there some flaw the pokedex not that big the move selection bit shortened and there quite lot repetition lack any form pvp even casually but aside from this this the best pokemon experience far 
26,this the best game has made more than years hope they continue this direction 
27,this everything imagined pokemon kid while there are some things think need adjustment the entire game absolutely refreshing love being able find shiny pokemon the wild just sitting there this the future all pokemon games absolutely board definitely favorite game yet 
28,excellent game great start for series hope continues evolve and put out multiple sequels 
29,the pokemon game needed recommend for pokemon fans well those who have never played pokemon game 
30,would guess most people that are rating low for graphics haven played the game unreal engine but has its own stylization charm and the visuals are not nearly bad some people are claiming ground textures could better but other visuals are also quite attractive the changes the game brings the stunning and clean sounds music maps and unique story all excel far know game freak and the pokemon company probably have the money hire the best the best but maybe they don want that and support grow the teams they already have this giant leap forward for the innovation pokémon games can imagine the future will only get better decide for yourself watch streams you need better place form your own opinion and open different gaming experiences hyper realism doesn need the standard for every aaa game 
31,great pokemon game must have role playing game for nintendo switch the gameplay amazing well 
32,just amazing this the new beginning for pokemón series off course graphics could better but you forget about that quickly when you start playing 
33,this first pokemon game and just want say that awesome never believed that say such thing this game made with love old school pokemon fans and newcomers 
34,despite its graphical problems this the way the franchise should walk must all pokemon and rpg fans 
35,enjoyed very much love all the changes they made this new pokemon game best pokemon game the last ten years 
36,dont believe what rat fan boys says about pla its great pokemon game the graphics are not good its 2gb graphic card but the big step its done love the game has everything that fans need 
37,where start yes get why people don like this game because the graphics however for someone like that has grown with pokemon red the early days year old child dream come true love this game much when played feel years again playing pokemon red for the first time gameboy colour nostagic aside the gameplay super fun everything feels smooth running throwing pokeball shinx and immediatly after that catching another one its addicitive and fun play only the first area and spend hours already for people that not like this game ask yourself the question are you really pokemon fan because don get why you can hate this game graphics aside gamefreak finally shake some things and hopefully they going improve this concept further with more gameplay options and much better graphics going back filling pokedex 
38,ignore negative reviews with ratings they are made handful miserable people who set out review bomb this game 
39,not about the graphics about the feelings the gameplay and being true rpg pokémon fan 
40,the most fun had playing pokémon game since firered refreshing and highly addicting gameplay hope pokémon continues this trend going forward 
41,don let the haters detract you this what been asking for and amazing the primary reason many are upset that not everything wanted all once but what does well introduce dizzying array long held changes the core life long fans have been asking for giant leap forward and makes what ever game comes next already top watch out for list lastly matter how you cage gamefreak and pokémon company have built much more mature story asked and put together design much closer the show then any previous game date play for yourself than judge 
42,amazing game bad graphics but the way that gamefreak must follow the perfect pokemon 
43,pokémon has had rough transition between the games getting easier the point being braindead the fact that routes feel less like places explore and more like corridors with occasional wild pokémon battles and the designs that keep getting worse and worse with each new generation the cracks the seams became lot more noticeable this reached its peak when the series made its proper jump the nintendo switch with pokémon sword and pokémon shield directed shigeru ohmori cutting about half the pokédex only sell back you later down the line and just generally looking like upscaled 3ds game and then get the long awaited sinnoh remakes with pokémon brilliant diamond and pokémon shining pearl directed junichi masuda only you wanted sinnoh remake that actually improved gen foundation you never going get one until modding gets more advanced with ohmori most likely working gen and masuda attempting polish bdsp enter kazumasa iwao director pokémon ultra sun and ultra moon the first game the era actually feel like game and think safe say that anyone needs the director future pokémon games needs iwao ohmori and masuda are holding the series back this was the big jump that pokémon needed and say delivers yeah the visuals aren that great and the game can either feel grindy like collectathon but with every pokémon you catch you making progress through the game currently about start the 5th area and the only reason didn make this review sooner that the game too much fun this game could very well shape the future pokémon you want more visual novels with occasional monster catching elements actual games sink your time into you want the latter then buy this game 
44,good gamefreak really outdid themselves this time and about time they did can recommend this game enough you gotten tired burned out the usual pokemon formula 
45,compared the previous entries the franchise this one hell game really good way 
46,great game new experience love pokémon and love nintendo exclusive buy now friend 
47,this the best pokemon ever made has faults but comparing the older games clearly the best game the people giving negative reviews are clearly people who just arent into pokemon and just want jump the gamefreak lazy hate train everyone know who loves pokemon playing non stop someone who got the game early and have battled arceus was one the most fun boss battles ever played and this game overall was fantastic 
48,solid great evolution but giving for the review bombing you mad that are having fun uwu 
49,perfect even both graphics and world blurry bad textures approve the experience play pokémon breath the wild zelda 
50,this the kind pokemon game were asking for years since pokemon black and white the franchise needed change and here 
51,this game fantastic yes graphically could better but least for doesn effect entertainment level this case the thing that really mattering just how much fun once have started hard stop for hours has gameplay loop that feels good and very much just one more thing sort loop this doubt favorite pokémon game have ever released and hope that the next big title learns from this game pokémon back baby 
52,has some problems sure but boy fantastic make all pokémon games like this from now please 
53,the only thing this game could improve graphics this huge step forward for pokemon 
54,this the summation various concepts that have been cooked within the franchise over the years fantastic game that knows what innovate and also knows what keep personally can get off the screen switch because catching pokémon and fighting with them against all kinds wild creatures totally stimulatinggame freak deserves all the love for this 
55,graphics aside think that this the best game the franchise far 
56,amazing gameplay feels fresh and makes you really feel like you interacting with the world and pokémon 
57,most fun had pokémon game years exploring the different areas and completing hisui pokédex addictive hope future installments build what currently set legends arceus 
58,the game even factoring the technical issues terribly good couldn imagine more immersive setting and gameplay the smoothness the gameplay loop ridiculously good truly having fun like the the first time played pokemon game and living the wonder felt diving into hyrule botw this rounded because some details the shadows should been dealt with properly the rest pretty much everything you ever wanted and little more 
59,game extremely fun been playing pokemon since blue red yellow came out and this really nice turn they achieved totally different then your traditional pokemon game and love wide open world pokemon everywhere what have been waiting for since kid what others have said graphics are bit meh but still really fun dangerous change they did and imo worked let hope they improve upon this for the next game 
60,love this new direction great and hope game freak expand the gameplay unique and only pokemon capable making this work 
61,best pokemon game this the way there way back this what pokemon needed 
62,this the way that pokémon games should the graphics not that bad and actually sort unique for pokémon games amazingly satisfying 
63,this game but because looks like they finally listen and there lot pointless going give them hope they continue down this path and continue improving the franchise they need put more effort the graphics love the style but there lot graphical problems also make the world feel more alive with more interactive pokemon and npcs also want see more dungeons and caves more moves and see how they improve the battle system more 
64,this easily one the best pokemon games released years highly recommend anyone 
65,the gameplay itself addictive innovative and good that rate this equalizes the downsides the graphics that are only sometimes bad general graphics are actually good and similar breath the wild sound good echoes caves and different great music situation like nearby strong enemies finally can love pokemon again all last games before were bad finally masterpiece the game mechanics itself are fun enough keep you playing 
66,easily the best pokémon game that has come from gamefreak all the new mechanics work and flow really nicely yes the graphics aren amazing but for what they are they are good 
67,the evolution the franchise needed hope the next game follows the same path this one 
68,absolutely addicted fantastic shake the formula and the best pokémon experience far date 
69,the most entertaining pokémon game ever there much done right that can make forgive the one big problem the underwhelming graphics other than that perfect game 
70,was very very bold move game freak changing the entire formula succesful franchise like pokémon believe this just the begining new generation pokémon games and happy part this the game awesome fun and beautiful don listen the haters some are just graphics weebs people who doesn like good changes enjoy this adventure 
71,the best pokemon game ever played the innovations the game are very successful gamefreak has shown what can whenever wants 
72,total step the right direction the game not perfect but first iteration something new comes close can haven been this engrossed pokemon game where spend many hours once playing quite long time 
73,the graphics are not great aside from that this one the most enjoyable pokemon games ever played might the most enjoyable people are really giving zero just because they don like the graphics the new forms 
74,been tired pokémon games for few years now but loved this game from start finish this was the perfect blend nostalgia and innovation not perfect but was huge step the right direction hope this will continue the new style games that game freak makes because there day one for all their new games 
75,game but because the best the series gets book lol 
76,best pokémon game since pokémon black and white like the new action and stealth elements the game 
77,probably the best pokémon switch game yet definitely the most fun anyone who complaining about graphics lack pokémon need see this the best jump forward for the video game franchise brilliant 
78,great stepping stone for the franchise hopefully gen builds this everything the world seamless and fun that you can sink endless hours 
79,best pokémon ever played doubt mean seriously this the change that pokemon needed 
80,incredible game this was what pokemon lacked funnyan incredible game this was what pokemon lacked interesting and funny really liked lot really like lot 
81,this game what pokemon nedeed for the future please not one off 
82,the best pokemon game yet definitely worth the time and money investment definitely step for the developers game freak look forward what they bring the future they should very proud this entry into pokemon canon 
83,muito bão mas muito bão mesmo isso sim very good forever now game its play nice camon inthe game very well the world chapion easy boy definitive game note maxima inthe game family 
84,pokémon legends arceus easily the next evolution the series presenting experience that blends elements action rpgs and open world adventure titles making for highly rewarding game for series newcomers and true believers alike the graphics and gameplay are among the best the series has offer making this must own title for pokémon fans and switch users everywhere 
85,far played hours haven finished the game yet but dude this amazing was bit worried would get repetitive but honestly the gameplay fun and feels rewarding fill your pokédex that doesn feel repetitive all there many side quests feels could keep going and going forever and always have something the new battle mechanics are incredible the most fun pokémon battles have ever been what shame there aren more battles tbh the game also quite hard found pokémon fainting lot but not hard the point where unplayable annoying just the right amount balance between easy and difficult you can comfortable play let put that way seeing the pokémon their natural habitat refreshing feels like playable version pokémon snap the gameplay fun the story original the characters have charisma the customization options are great more unlock whilst you progress the game the crafting cool and even though the graphical aspect isn the best admittedly honestly does not take away from the gameplay all just that fun point did feel like the graphics were worsening experience and since the artstyle beautiful you don even feel like the game ugly but yeah considering was never bother don even want lower the score because far the only flaw have found you pokémon fan you will love this you not you will probably like too 
86,best game pokemon long time the change the formula little works nicely lot story and new mechanics makes this game perfect hope that will new line legends games other regions 
87,all can say this game breath fresh air 
88,absolutely revolutionary for the pokemon franchise loved every bit the game this certainly step the right direction good job gamefreak 
89,much better than the last remake and for more appealing than sword and shield have played all the pokemon games from red the last remake and this feels like breath fresh air course graphics are not great but know that have nintendo switch with half tflops regular ps4 least runs 1080 docked 
90,its refreshing pokemon game that feels much fun the mechanics are good and catching all pokemons has become much immersive than ever before hope the series will continue this open world feel 
91,amazing game complete revamp the pokemon game concept though the graphics are slightly disappointing this game more than makes for sheer fun 
92,far the best pokémon game all time far superior any way comparing past games this ridiculous 
93,played for well over hours and barely scratched the surface great value and quickly becoming one favourites being honest could become the very first but haven finished the main story yet 
94,this the best pokémon game since soul silver pokemon games should have had this type gameplay since the switch graphics this spin off better than most the previous pokémon games and gamefreak should focus all their attention making pokémon games this style from now 
95,love the total shift the gameplay right from the start could visually better but the end gameplay wins which streamlined and fast pla super addictive and time just flies while enjoying the exploration hopefully this gameplay mechanic will seen through new pokemon games and hope much that there will always main line pokemon games also 
96,you can say what you want about the graphics not being perfect but the game experience pokemon arceus delivers makes far the best pokemon game the franchise 
97,very enjoyable game thus far the best game the series doubt convinced the people spamming the game with score reviews haven even touched 
98,could better but rating game freak realizes this format has lot potential they make sequel 
99,honest expected less however right the game entrance was amazed see how diffrent the game feels thought that arceus would lackluster and new fighting style pokemon wouldn entertaining and simply won have the same effect nevertheless was proven wrong could wrote even more about this masterpiece pokemon game but too lazy 
100,addictive game love exploring sneaking around throwing stuff collecting items actually the crafting feature very fun one the best games played 
101,best pokémon game ever played switches the formula ways the series desperately needed and lays the groundwork for more innovation the future 
102,this game the best pokemon game dont know why peoples hate can promise this masterpiece first all everyone said the map empty and just catch fight game play agree with the point but the situation only appear your initial initial period initial period the tutorial teach how explore the without any function such swimming climbing and fly when you got all you will very enjoy the pokemon world there the new fight system new gameplay style these good things all pokemon fans want this best pokemon game also mix with breath the wild style and very love though someone said the graphics worst have say pokemon videogame and the videogame its mission funny and make player enjoy think game freak has been finish their mission get the great result 
103,this game amazing played hours and having blast and probably will playing for much longer 
104,fascinated with how new this title brings been hours now and can stop playing the music and sounds nature are immersive the world wide and fun explore you can make your own tools the story interesting one the best pokemon games years 
105,have been playing since red and blue and this feels like the first time that have had that level interest and enjoyment from playing pokemon game the new mechanics are great which leaves very engaging and addicting gameplay loop there are some nice quality life improvements but most importantly shiny hunting really streamlined and feels more obtainable rather than doing obscure shiny hunting method recommend this you love pokemon but want fresh change 
106,excellent game ideal for people all ages its main story may seem easy but its huge post game where keeps the challenge for the most experienced pokémon 
107,remarkable game and that everything does has function within its proposal and system with enviable exploration and way interact with pokémon like never seen before the big problem has the mostly negative fandom which attempts have been made discredit everywhere unfair and incoherent comparisons have been made with other games and they have sought glorify indies that blatantly plagiarize pokémon better when fact they are inferior see temtem nexomon out simple hatred and resentment for national pokédex none this helped them because the game turned out the opposite the malicious prejudices that were being formed well made gameplay that meets being fun objectives and missions not are repetitive all excelent music good story good difficulty curve good artthere are many things that arceus legends well 
108,very good game didn really like what tpci gave over the last few years but this one very different the gameplay feels very new and different but does not eliminate the important elements for pokemon catching and stealth system feels very fun the difficulty the game not too difficult nor too easy but there are some battles that feel difficult the main thing that finally puts effort into the game itself 
109,honestly love the game its mechanics are dynamic and realistic and there many quality life improvements the story really nice and for the first time really excited complete the dex the bosses are challenging and the game general incredible opinion don find the graphics bad they are natural progression top game must have 
110,arguably the best pokemon has been about years with clear influence from games like monster hunter and breath the wild pokémon legends arceus gives you the freedom explore that you wish you had pokémon snap with all the attractions main series pokémon game and more 
111,incredible how game freak managed use whole new playing method different than the pokemon formula they used the previous games and still managed incredible work opinion easily top pokemon only behind masterpieces such platinum and heart gold 
112,incredible evolution for the pokémon franchise the graphics need better but the game amazing and you can spend hours and hours just having fun the new battle mechanic great the capture mechanic really good well 
113,the game bold step towards better future for the franchise its super fun expansive lots things story better than previous main entries etc still has room for improvement specially when comes the graphics and other technical aspects but are going get more pokemon games like this the future all 
114,had really fun time playing this game graphically the game isn the best and have say was pretty upset with the fact there was online battles but this setting something fantastic for the future pokemon really excited whats come 
115,the pokémon game that wanted since childhood addicting the game rewards you for everything loving this game much 
116,quickly becoming one top switch games hadn played pokémon game since diamond but this one making super fan 
117,this game really cool the mechanics are complex enough make success feel rewarding but not tedious the same time has what you love about pokémon game reworked without all the repetitive stuff the gameplay loop going out and researching pokémon and then coming back the hub manage your inventory quests etc addicting the performance doesn ruin the immersion but could better this game has lot variation really experience and gives the same feeling felt when playing other famous switch titles looking forward seeing the publisher build off this formula 
118,when was years old pokemon blue and red version were released the gameboy pokémon legends arceus everything that imagined blue version was while playing all those years ago opinion this the greatest thing happen the franchise 
119,glad finally see some ambition graphics drop this game you not pokemon fan but giving because want all the next pokemon games ambitious this one 
120,incredible game the best the franchise mixing the greatest mechanics from pokemon and open world games general 
121,was simply awesome the new mechanics are very fun and very welcomed after years the same formula must buy the switch 
122,please don pay attention the minority poor reviews this game needless say giving this game isn accurate and gives insight how good for someone who has played pokémon since the very beginning this game what wanted since was kid already put hours into legends arceus and can wait continue playing 
123,have been very prejudiced with this title and with its studio this game takes the idea catching pokémon another level that have never experienced the main sagai love how you can fight with any pokémon and that the battle environment the same overworld the difficulty quite decent imo despite what some say about its graphics they are actually lovely 
124,the best pokemon game all franchise new formula and everything this game hard work game freak bring legends arceus can stop play 
125,this what the franchise and the fans needed amazing open world filled with pokémon best recent pokémon game far 
126,never expected pokemon game grab like the days old been sort going through the motions with previous titles the mainline games but this one has going deeper into great see the changes graphics damned the game good not the prettiest one the pokeball 
127,spoiler free review overall this game pretty good even though the graphics and textures are not the best they still okay the other hand they put lot effort into the characters models pokémon and animations general the gameplay mechanics are also really refreshing compared the predecessors and the story doesn follow the typical pokémon formula evil enemy team get all badges beat the champion barely encountered any bugs and even when encountered one wasn anything game breaking and didn disturb that much all all enjoy this game lot especially because expectations weren that high was really surprised when the game turned out good important know that gamefreak barely made any games that weren top down perspective before definitely lacks some depth terms world design but that will definitely get better the more games they make this kind style really hard change whole developers studio workflow just like the old pokémon games the graphics will probably get better from game game about myself the only pokémon games played were firered let and sword shield because mainly gamer know that there are things missing from old pokémon games but from non biased non nostalgic perspective definitely enjoyable gameplay experience 
128,well think the best pokemon game since gen story great for pokemon game too 
129,the game step the right direction anyone who gave anything under either didn play just hater throwing out all over 
130,hours and far the best pokémon experience ever the only drawback the game graphics but considering the game development cycle was only year don mind the character story pokémon and soundtrack are great well but definitely the best part the entire game the gameplay they completely revamped the pokémon gameplay and worth 
131,the greatest pokémon main series game history little lacking but graphics are more advanced than the previous series vast and moderately divided territories fun collect proper fusion existing series and actions bosses various patterns sub quests that not interfere with main content and dramatic stories how can this game boring was able feel with whole body that gamefreak worked hard 
132,awesome game recomend for all pokemon fans innovative game good job game freak 
133,loving the game not the best graphics but step the right direction love being able roll off mountains wish there was jump button but enjoying the game right now and can wait for future versions 
134,just good there aren many other words describe how well game freak has managed deal with new style game after polishing and improving the current system for years its game that everyone has play only playing understood because despite the average graphics one falls love and has fixed the screen 
135,limit the quality this game only the graphics think very reductionist way limit the discourse mononeuristic direction that doesnt benefit anyone seek any solution only complain destructive way without any reason this game surprisingly fun vast and full things once you start the journey hard get off until you finish the prejudice that the general community has for the game could not better described than with the word unfair play and you know what mean 
136,pokémon legends arceus innovates and moves the pokémon franchise many ways pokémon battle transitions seamlessly take place the overworld and only happen when you throw out one your pokémon pokéball this removes annoying random encounters but there still danger traversing the wild aggressive pokémon will attack you pretty difficult battle animations have received overhaul and now look super cool and actually run over and hit each other they are also properly sized and wild pokémon are now more powerful there are side quests well this super good game that you should buy 
137,game completely the circumstances and that meets every expectationpokémon switch simply fire with each game the franchise gets better 
138,one the best games that game freak has made along with emerald platinum ultra moon and shield expansion the leap quality they have made such short time incredible 
139,this game exactly what pokemon needed not perfect but the new mechanics and the freedom are too good imagine explore kanto with this formula please gamefreak this the way 
140,have been told that game very similar botw but when finished last night was the complete opposite this game does have good story devoid filler characters has world with interesting things more than the empty plains the game with which compared and instead being filled with hundreds shrines and kologs each pokémon catch new experience and challenge without falling into monotony love pokémon legends and everything that proposed and the comparisons seem more than hateful has nothing with botw nor will have its game that its own style knows how stand out and memorable 
141,loving the battle mechanics are fun the only downside for the graphics overall breath fresh air for the franchise 
142,great game get right now grrrrrrrr you better buy because good and review this long because can make shorter 
143,best game ever really love the graphics and everything about great this might just favorite game all time 
144,pokémon legends arceus objectively the best pokémon game since heartgold soulsilver since the series gradual decline into stagnation and mediocrity starting with black white felt like there was hope for pokémon games good again each title was getting worse and worse then comes legends arceus brand new spin the tired and overdone pokémon formula with world that actually feels open and alive and gameplay that doesn bore you death legends arceus also brings plethora actual qol changes the franchise that masuda and ohmori were hesitant bring such being able learn moves whenever you want and completely reworking the terrible bloated nature system that ruby sapphire introduced kazumasa iwao the kind person that needs charge the main series pokémon games from now the fact that swshills are attacking this game for actually having ounce effort put into and actually well being good game just shows that legends arceus the kind change the series needed hopefully generation will follow the footsteps legends arceus 
145,gameplay incredible mix zelda breath the wild exploration the vast over world and monster hunter style concept with the pokemon charm totally blew away the story top notch the best pokemon game ever released everything wanted pokemon when going 
146,huge step the right direction with pla foundation the future pokémon games looks bright not perfect and understand the qualms regarding the graphics and lack voice acting however this major improvement over the lackluster and lazy sword shield and having blast you the fence recommend giving chance would given but since many trolls are review bombing bumping try and balance out most fun had pokémon game since red blue 
147,normally give this game but since everyone giving zeros 
148,this the best pokémon game ever played everything always dreamed since was kid playing red blue yes the graphics could better but the game much fun that makes for happy that game freak finally left their comfort zone and tried something new love with this game and can stop playing 
149,this the pokemon game have looking for since kid despite the bad graphic this game insanely good for 
150,overall this game great stepping stone for the pokémon franchise whole the mechanics and gameplay are phenomenal and feel this great starting point for the games going forward all friends who have picked this game absolutely love the game and are having blast anyone who has rated this game you are just review bombing this game you have absolutely nothing complain about nintendo did great job showing off all kinds different videos showing off gameplay 
151,best pokémon game long long time fresh take pokémon just what was needed good gameplay 
152,really liked may not graphic masterpiece but lot fun the changes are positive and because they are positive they tend stay and improved the future not take seriously the opinion those who have not played and simply say that not worth because the graphics you can sure that someone said that the game not good because the graphics that person did not play play and see how fun the game isit important step for franchising they been trying evolve year series and they the right track thinking pokemon legends arceus can almost called successful draft highly recommend anyone who fan the franchise who doesn play pokemon and doesn have the weight nostalgia probably won enchanted the game 
153,this game demands improvements and not perfect however what game filled with wonder exploration and fun hope for future entries build top the foundation that pokemon legends arceus and join other list nintendo games such breath the wild metroid dread xenoblade and pla steals attention with its smooth and seamless gameplay numerous side missions and monsters tame absolutely gorgeous music along with difficulty curve that refreshing for long time players seeking challenge alpha pokemon are especially fun and quite the challenge and had going the first time ran into one graphics are lacking sure but not nearly bad some may say fact some areas are beautiful enough worthy screenshot the art direction reminiscent ancient japanese ink paintings which believe was deliberate considering the era which pla takes place anyone who has played okami will surely recognize this style this game that can prove deniers that graphics are not solely what makes gaming experience great special hours and still without facing the first noble and have not felt any inkling boredom the slightest can easily see myself spending many hours exploring and discovering give this game absolutely worth the price 
154,usually don leave ratings this solid 10very addictive obviously there are some issues including the lackluster graphics the barren landscapes etc giving counteract the scores given 
155,pokémon legends arceus manages work the stale formula the mainline pokémon series which hasn been well received nearly two decades the game finds way blend more pokémon esc mechanics with the traditional pokémon battle system almost seamlessly into open environments the point where never got tired trying catch everything could find unfortunately the game does have make some sacrifices allow for its likely short development time due the pokémon company eagerness get games out quickly this most apparent when judging the game from graphical perspective which for game that feels like should like nice due its attempts botw esc environments absolutely fails look more botw were for the wii although keep mind that footage the game likely looks far worse than the game itself since for example youtube compression hardcore messes the grass additionally there are only about 240 pokémon which seems little disappointing but considering they actually gave them new animations and worked them into the game world that much more would just feel impossible implement only few years regardless its flaws the game still comes out ton fun with its new gameplay loop and intriguing story and still earns high rating book 
156,pokémon legends arceus great game amazing open world feels like true rpg catching pokémon better than ever pokémon models are great the pokémon battles are amazing this game new positive direction the pokémon franchise also the exploration amazing and very rewarding the ranks are nice arceus great visual game with the mechanics the game not being repetitive all the story great and the unique pokemon the game are the most coolest things you ever saw overall pokémon legends arceus one the best pokémon games ever that recommend buying 
157,the fans can never happy this game fun and can bring new fans this game doesnt repeat what the last previous games has done only problem that doesnt have good draw distance however this game fun better then other games and will always criticized because fans arent happy get what they want sword and shield wasnt that bad game people who dont play these games also criticized without proof angry joe definitely one them because claimed this for kids yet played animal crossing rating but definitely because its good story 
158,the new system gives very new fun the fun collecting has doubled than before difficulty levels bring interest the game 
159,best pokemon game decade this what fans have been wanting for years the catching and battling mechanics feels good 
160,what amazing game the gameplay just fluid the first pokemon game that makes you want complete the pokedex this game wonderful step forward this franchise the difficulty level just perfect you can get over levelled but the wild pokemon constantly tag team you making 2v1 maybe 3v1 the greatest flaw this game its graphics some textures are actually really ugly the moves are actually pretty beautiful but sometimes the trees even the pokemon are not that good looking besides the fps constantly decreases but not way that bothers you lot since the game changes lot the core mechanics this game easily the most noob friendly game the franchise making the player learn about pokemon they play overall pokemon legends arceus fantastic game with fantastic mechanics the closest ever got the dream pokemon game not because know the graphics can better but every single aspect this game makes want play even more update what fantastic ending arc now this game indeed 
161,excellent game visuals not distract from the incredible gameplay flow the best story and gameplay loop the series has ever had 
162,new world experience love the new features worth time really enjoyed 
163,the gameplay elements are very fun and interesting this game and are big step forward for the series though the graphics could improve 
164,botw graphics the pokemon always wanted hope gamefreak continue this way and make aaa game with this formula 
165,really nice game for anyone who has been complaining about these games for the past few generations 
166,most fun had while with pokemon game the new mechanics are really cool and really feels like you are part the game huge step the right direction and excited see what they will bring the future 
167,graphics dont make game people expect much people call themselves pokemon fans but cant see the potential leaking out this game for the future great game takes the best lets parts and the main series game and throws them together exciting way ive put hours into the game far and stilll get excited everytime see new pokemon the distortion rifts add fun way get rare items and pokemon that make sense the story well gameplay the dodge machanic also feature that works well from the story letting you know that the world dangerous and dont know much about music great gameplay great story great game imo great changes for future titles this 
168,this the most interesting game the graphic very good and theres are funny asdfk 
169,perfect example pokémon and what wanted after seeing the first episode the anime even with the technical limitations the switch expands the series great new direction and sets roadmap for the future 
170,fun all have eyes but gameplay ist still the most important think and its great botw feelings 
171,best pokemon experience had since b2w2 started the series with yellow ecstatic about this direction 
172,best game pokemon far this great change for franchise have support this type big changes and not destroy with ridiculous ratings without non sense 
173,pokémon legends arceus the greatest surprise for the last years playing pokémon expected game with small content horrible graphics and middle quality gameplay what got was lot content graphics that are okay and gameplay that has higher quality than could dream really hope that get second part few years because didn feel such joy while playing pokémon for least the last ten years 
174,this format like see for future pokemon games freedom explore tedious walking through grass and constantly encountering pokemon the effort point system miles ahead the old system changing moves the fly the menu amazing the only downside that can hard see some pokemon from distance also moving forward should into more voice acted approach for these games because can seem bit quiet 
175,thought would not like turns out one the best switch games fae 
176,this far the greatest pokémon game ever made really hope they continue the trend doing corresponding legends games for each existing generation 
177,far one the most enjoyable pokémon games played going all the way back red and blue miss having lot trainer battles however the new mechanics introduced the game and the story have made the game very enjoyable hope they can continue off this game and make more with the new features that were introduced 
178,arceus the game all wanted since were little been playing for years now and this refreshing and exciting take the franchise 
179,the gane awesome this the pokémon what needs transform better experience 
180,best pokemon game all time chupem haters mandaram muito bem dessa vez 
181,lifelong fan from playing pokémon yellow years old pokémon legends arceus wow just wow okay this game you love the franchise even new beautiful addicting gameplay that offers amazing experience 
182,insanely good game really unique and amazing experience there are many cool new features that could partly even make into the main series because how good improvement they are not even close finishing the game especially storywise because busy completing dex entries but can alr tell you its more than worth check out huge recommendation even non pokémon fans 
183,now have hours gameplay the new pokemon and more fun than been long time the fluid gameplay between catch fight and explore just awesome yes gamefrak didn put much effort into the graphics and preferred put their resources into the reorientation the gameplay that would the only point criticism for otherwise the new pokemon convinces all along the line 
184,very close the pokemon game that everyone has dreamed for years rather innovative game compared the usual main series which the company acts boldly the quality the animations this time and the fact that offers very fluid game experience the open area were the aspects liked the most really liked this game 
185,hands down the best pokemon game ever made everything you ever wanted can wait for this series continue 
186,course that not true rating but until people will allowed vote which isn realistic for any game will have give fake vote for balancing addictive game and really fun despite technical blunders 
187,fantastic departure from the same tired formula may not the most visually impressive game but graphics never made game truly great begin with the poke collecting adventuring battling all feels fresh and fun the world incredible and all the lore tidbits are going please any long term pokefanatic 
188,the best pokemon game ever made finally after years shaked the formula and worked the game looks terrible but still masterpiece 
189,best pokemon game ever really laid the groundwork for the future games free roam what have always wanted and the updates the move pool system the graphics everything awesome only wish was kept the same 
190,this step the right direction hopefully they incorporate some these mechanics into the next generation 
191,pokemon legends arceus not only incredibly fun game incredibly fun pokemon game that means something especially when until now releases new pokemon games have gone more stale than old bread changes almost all the mechanics which made the pokemon games monotonous and tedious and changed them into really fun mechanics story elements very well mixed into gameplay and while the game not par with the likes fable skyrim rpgs still fun experience and definitive step the right direction you haven tried pokemon yet this the game try you are long time fan the series like myself you feel sense astonishment that pokemon game can actually enjoyable game freak and the pokemon company have finally listened fans woes must noted that the game graphics can hit miss times with some animations looking like stop motion this hasn taken away from the experience though 
192,fun new pokémon experience think the graphics get entirely too much hate aside from one particularly ugly cloud everything looks nice and has watercolor sort feel can easily sink over hours into and the core gameplay loop fun 
193,one the best pokémon game ever breath fresh air the series that long overdue all though the graphics lack 
194,best pokémon game date really enjoying from the gameplay the mechanics everything feels fresh 
195,this the best pokémon game they have ever made and they not iterate these systems will disappointed 
196,feels really amazing actually have new pokemon game where don already know how everything before even start capturing pokemon whole new experience the fighting more dynamic and way less straightforward the progression very zelda like where you are more pokemon researcher than trainer overall this the best way this franchise could possibile grow excited for the future 
197,personally think legends arceus the best pokemon game since gen not stating that gen are bad just that gen was favorite game until now could change again not entirely sure enjoying lot hours far here are the highlights for far although not going win any awards the story the best pokemon game has done long time catching mechanic amazing more going into battle weaken them and then throw pokeball just hide toss wait and repeat necessary there are some limits and exceptions though there something very satisfying running across pokemon you didn know was the game that rare spawn pikachu eevee chimchar etc are all available the first area you can choose when evolve your pokemon once they have met the requirements you can switch out moves anywhere any time long the pokemon knows them more forgetting moves and having reteach them you mess boss encounters are fun and challenging times although you not gonna lose anything you die specific mechanic spoilers that opens mid story very challenging you want after them for the rare items and spawns alpha pokemon are very fun fight and catch they have the highest the game and are actually smart lol personally like the graphical style they chose again not going win any awards but like 
198,honestly its not perfect but lovable and has charm similar the original games spent long doing side quests finding pokémon new locations and finally catching hard get pokémon honestly the game feels good and alive been critical pokémon since oras but this great experience for hardcore fan like 
199,one the best pokemon games ever have now over 20h playtime and are done with the main story and was sooo funny yeah the grafics aren the best but the mechanics are smooth and feels good catch pokemon farm resorces hope that the incoming games are like this 
200,love the idea makes hope for better future also the nature not perfect but for switch think they did great job and going wnjoy 
201,best pokemon game far and most relaxing and exploring also fun and graphics issues seems nothing 
202,the game was the must fun had with pokemon game long time shakes the formula the right way keeping things interesting and making you think about how and when approach pokemons the only downside the graphics should have been better and think could have better they dedicated the game bit more time development giving even with its flaws because hope they will use this game the stepstone build future installments rather that going back the old formula for the next generation games 
203,good job enjoying this game lot this the way game freak have take maybe the graphics are not the best but the rest fun and enjoyable sincerely love 
204,one the best games and one the best pokémon serious candidate for best rpg the game awards 
205,this game revitalizes the pokemon formula with tons new ideas and advances for the franchise have not enjoyed pokemon game this much long time and played every generation pokemon since gen the gameplay loop engaging and really inscentivises catching many pokemon possible sidequests are pretty diverse and never feel like copy pastes each other also every npc jubilife village has name and feels like real character and love that 
206,this one the best pokémon games that have ever been made the game play fun the story one the most surprising aspects the game don listen the negative review there are lot can take from this game and what can come the future there definitely improvements the game but truly love and have been having playing for days now 
207,pokémon legends arceus everything that sword and shield wished could said what said 
208,the pokemons are cute and there are many new things check out love this 
209,this game exactly what the franchise needed finally step out its niche know lots people are criticizing graphics but the graphics are honestly pretty decent you got remember that this nintendo switch not xbox series ps5 gone about hours into the game and still haven completed the story meanwhile know people who beaten the story after hours which goes show that you can really set the pace this game with dozens upon dozens side quests fair sized pokedex complete and beautiful story pokemon legends arceus the next step the pokemon universe and truly excited see what the next step the franchise will take 
210,opinion this the best game that pokémon has done since gen iii and the most creative period say that someone who has played every generation and enjoyed all them somewhat really captures what people should expect from the franchise and hope sets the standard going forward the new battle system fantastic the art direction works well and the gameplay honestly pretty engrossing 
211,best pokemon experience ever good mechanics great gameplay nice back story 
212,gamefreak first big deviation from very successful formula while still utilizing the parts that made pokemon great graphics not stunning but they not detract from the experience gameplay the flow between battle and open world seamless more waiting seconds everytime you encounter pokemon someone who started with 1st gen and quit playing due pacing issues after gen pick again recently the pace feels much faster than any game since gen setting design the designs the region pokemon have old world theme them the rest are you would know and love except garados flying though the sky like boeing 747story while have not finished the game yet not the same story that has been every pokemon game past gen boring badge hunt instead are filling out the pokedex gain stars within the faction best feature everything experience contained one game not two titles with pokemon missing from each summery think this the best thing that can happen pokemon feels like step forward for franchise that has stuck new coat paint the same game for the last years hope this sticks and become the new standard for the main line pokemon games 
213,really love the game gives the good old feelings being chad and having thick but good time 
214,this has favorite pokemon game all time and not even that far into the game yet easily puts this game into top games all time the exploration very rewarding along with being able pace break the game given some trial and error regarding catch rates the overall theming absolutely wonderful and being able interact with your pokemon new ways always nice and sweet thing absolutely recommend anyone who pokemon fan enjoys collect thons open world games 
215,think trying something new pokemon game awesome and this game gives many new features and new style 
216,amazing game love capturing all the mons exploring completing side quest and more the story really cool there are explonations for some the things that are pokemon like why spear piller ruins and how the reigon got the name shino just wonderfull obviusly this not the perfect pokemon game but close some the things wish were litle better are the graphis wich aren bad just not good wanted yeh greate game recommend 
217,new pokémon refreshing change pace the franchise great play experience with the new catching mechanics 
218,everything place here only they had worked the visuals more and added some form voiceover would have been pity because the next game the series will not that big moment for the franchise anymore matter what looks like like waste opportunity impress everyone and sadly great gameplay overshadowed visual problems for still the best pokemon game since gen2 
219,absolutely adore this game been playing pokemon since was four and diacovered every single generation but couldn really enjoy anything that came out after and legends arceus the other hand gives sense immersion other game freak game has created the game whole just works perfectly within its own world sure the graphics won win prices but they also didn bother and the gameplay more than makes for game freak delivered and hope they learn from this game and continue improve every aspect 
220,this the best pokemon game since third generation cant stop playing 
221,have been playing pokémon games since and have over hours this current title have say the most fun have ever had pokémon game usually get bored after the credits roll and may play another hours with previous titles brilliant diamond have 110 hours played but nowhere near fun this game the action based catching mechanics are perfect try sneak pokémon and catch and that fails smack with mud ball and try catch again movement with the mounts and the freedom movement the game very welcome addition graphics could better and could more polished but overall the value entertainment pokémon legends arceus spot also enjoyed the story and side stories the game hope this title the bestselling pokémon game ever that can get more pokémon titles like this updates and additions this game 
222,best pokémon game far very addicting been playing days straight 
223,the best pokémon game fan the main series always considered almost perfect the original formula but with this game gamefreak reinvented the franchise with new combat system exciting gameplay amazing music and entertaining campaign the only issue with the game the nintendo switch outdated hardware 
224,person who played all the pokémon games including the spin offs never enjoyed something this universe like legends arceus addicting well made and kinda impossible for stop playing its the kinda game that you play until you fall sleep really hope that the pokémon company keep going with that format and understand that this was the best step they took all pokémon franchise 
225,haven had this much fun pokemon game since heartgold soulsilver please game freak continue with this system 
226,think this the best pokémon game reinvention the graphics could better but there are vas love the new pokémon the music incredible the best point all the posibilities that you can capture history pokedex enamorus tótem horrible

237,this easily one the best pokemon games since pokemon black and white era breath fresh air for the pokemon series and having the ability able roam around catch new pokemon experience new little details that were added the game the tutorial whilst little too long for liking still teaches you all the ropes the game and once you get over that longer the hand holding game that has been the previous games being able ignore the main story for hours end just you can explore and experience new areas pokemon and witness them with sentience something else that amazing the battle system has been reworked and will take little bit get used however once you get the ropes the battle system along with strong and agile style moves lots great strategies can born and once you master the battle system will extremely fun play around with using moves that you might not before and using strategies that you would have never even thought the dark theme the game overall with death mauling and having the fear pokemon struck into your heart when they attack you the wild and you must run away and fear for your life they chase you down step toward something great pokemon aren just creatures that will trainers bidding they were once wild untamed and shows this era pokemon that they possessed true threat humankind the graphics are little off but who plays pokemon for the graphics all about the creatures and catching them all which desperately needed this game actually complete overall pokemon legends arceus very fun and addicting game the music the background you explore something that can easily enjoyed the gameplay loop incredibily enjoyable for those that are completionists and want 100 complete game certainly step the right direction for the pokemon company and this great solid baseline for future games 
238,what pokémon game fantastic step the right direction for the series opinion anyway enjoyed much with much more enjoyable story then previous games with certain great characters and great moments throughout the story well neat connection other games with familiar ancestors characters which feels good when you spot the connection the gameplay can consistently fun just stick whatever you feel like doing and definitely don play with guide much more fun your own experience and course the pokémon are great and there good amount variety them and well shiny hunting actually possible and not incredibly time consuming but still good challenge and most importantly just fun and sure what pokémon game before have you been able tackled off mountain gligar 
239,this the best new way play pokémon game not for little kids anymore and the content solid needs some more enhancements and more pokémon but all all perfect game 
240,this game awesome look forward nintendo pushing new design for pokémon and excited see the future pokémon games based 
241,this the type pokemon game been waiting for for decades love the open world and getting see and interact with pokemon such fluid way love that the pokedex goes beyond obtain complete but includes much more than just catching one pokemon and satisfying complete tasks and explore the game percect definitely not but absolutely step the right direction and hope the pokemon crew take this success and runs with please continue build improve upon this type open world game and don let one off with little more artistic polish and depth story would amazing game 
242,what you imagine pokemon should like you watched the show its amazing game with much catch and makes you really want catch them all 
243,loving there never boring moment there tons stuff the act throwing the ball the pokémon and the target system lot fun crafting the things you need poke balls potions etc was great idea for this game 
244,fantastic game the future the franchise never before pokémon world has been alive neither the mediocre anime adaptation the graphics without doubt can grow exponentially next chapter and could step from incredible game proper masterpiece great hope for the future 
245,legends arceus easily the most fun had with pokémon game very long time this the game that makes optimistic for the future pokémon 
246,this amazing this one the best pokimon games 
247,haven had this much fun pokémon since the original ruby sapphire emerald 
248,don want write big review but this one favourite games ever yeah doesn have the best graphics but pokemon fan honestly won care all its for could play all day just want play just find any flaws then for but you played for quite bit you know its sick game and really enjoyable 
249,the new mechanics are very fun and very welcomed after years the same formula 
250,this one the best pokémon games played years the story amazing the new features are pleasant and the twist the end where volo was evil and wanted the plates summon arceus himself came way out left field and didn expect all actually felt betrayed when showed his true colors the goal the game simple catch all the pokémon and the first person complete the first pokédex the hisui region finally the final boss fight against arceus amazing his patterns are difficult learn and when you beat him you get him added your pasture and not only that but they finally gave arceus the power the legendary plate which finally allows arceus every type once game can wait for the next generation pokémon and what game freak and the pokémon company will have for the future 
251,absolutely love this game fantastic evolution the series have been looking for encapsulates most things that makes pokémon special call these things the elements discovery growth and adventure seeing pokémon fully realised space makes the experience more seamless while the flow made the quality life changes makes everything instantaneous absolutely fantastic see game freak challenge the player and make pokémon genuinely threatening both your pokémon and the player the gameplay loop flows well keeps myself continuing engaged testament its accessibility and gameplay design this game has its flaws but easy overlook when more excited about pokémon than have been years see the possibilities where the series could would love see trainer battles and more civilisation realised future entries particularly with battles would give further reason strategise developing your team especially with grand scale such tall mountain like the battle with red pokémon silver and gold 
252,absolutely the most beautiful and involving pokémon game have played lot time the change was for good 
253,really enjoying this game quite the unique take the pokémon series 
254,this game like crack best pokemon game years much fun graphics aren the best but really isn bad handheld mode and the gameplay makes for any shortcomings 
255,great fresh addition the series some performance and graphical issues but overall hope see more entries with this format 
256,amazing game like ninja isekai pokémon breath the wild love child super addictive and fun 
257,finally the game have waiting many years freedom tangible pokemon much more dynamic battles story that not bad all and many hours fun which reminds the illusion first pokemon even there are still people who believe that game only its graphics invite them sell their nintendo switch and buy another console because they are wrong 
258,best pokemon game long time the are minor issues with the textures and frame rate but still amazing game 
259,best pokemon experience would say previous games have been tedious and too easy and easy games mean fun this game significantly more challenging and very enjoy the pokemon are more vivid and for the first time have the desire fill the pokedex instead finishing the main story soon possible although the graphic not the best especially water would say this game great leap and truly have blast 
260,amazing game this the way gamefreak should follow for the next pokemon games just improving and polishing graphics 
261,game awesome first hours might feel bit slow but after that really fun also the history the best the pokemon series even better than opinion the music fantastic too and the graphics might feel bit sharp the beginning but you progress the game feels much more smooth especially handheld mode 
262,pls more just take more time for fixing bugs and better graphics 
263,well normally wouldn give this game but but because there are many morrons here which give the game will give giving this game just even just objectivly not true even you dislike the game now where start with this game personally absolutly adore have over hours right now put into and think the best pokemon game since black white personally was never fan the pokemon games until legends arceus came out now want address the biggest issue people have first the graphics the graphics are sided coin this game you look the game mode looks terrible simply terrible the performance mode also terrible often feels like fps game but you look this game handheld mode can actually look really pretty some parts you have the game already just compare run through jubilife village between the mode and the handheld mode you will notice that the handheld mode runs extremly well and looks really good some areas but you will also notice that the mode the opposite that would advise anyone play this game only handheld mode personally can only say that this game because only played handheld mode have judge the game mode would that how big the difference even despite acknowledging the bad graphics mode still think lot reviews here are extremly unfair towards the game calling gamefreak lazy terrible this case not true pokemon legends arceus was clearly passion project for gamefreak you can see lot details they put the game especially jubilife village that probably the best pokemon village town had since the games went there are many small details put into jubilife village insane for spoiler reasons will not mention any will just say this game was clearly passion project for gamefreak and even with flaws like the terrible mode you can clearly see that they tried this time with the game honestly want this the main take away from anyone who reads this review the game awesome you play handheld game but you play homeconsole game mediocre best honestly would wish that gamefreak just disabled the mode for this game and made handheld only yes people would still angry about that but think would have way less people complaining about the graphics gamefreak was just honest with their terrible mode also sadly just shows how the switch itself makes hard judge games like said give this game because morrons put negative reviews out which are way negative for such wellpolished handheld game the other hand can understand those reviews they only played mode like said would personally give this game handheld game but homeconsole game the area also shows the duality the switch itself the console itself great but there are always set backs which drag down can clearly see with other switch games too for example breath the wild can sometimes have bad performance you play mode but handheld mode completly fine now didn really talk about gameplay story anything like that because think quite clear that enjoyed the gameplay itself would give this game about the story really liked some the characters they are not great but entertaining enough the story itself good but not great more less just excuse send you running through the world general this game extremly gameplay focused and really don want say anything about that because there are lot surprises here not comparable previous pokemon games that much clear but opinion gamefreak should continue going the legends direction the next legends game not the switch more powerful switch might even get game with working handheld and mode gonna add one thing here people who give this game are objectivly wrong even the graphics were terrible everyone said which they are only for mode and even than could way worse this game objectivly not zero morrons like that should honestly stop playing pokemon general why because disencouraging gamefreak now with bad review scores really not the thing need now don say just blindly applaud them but people continue hate this game will just get the same old terrible pokemon formula again 
264,best pokemon game ever great interaction with pokemon nice game play and decent story and sub quests hope that game freak keeps this direction develop new pokemon game really enjoy 
265,this was exciting new leap and formula for pokemon have played every game from since red and blue from the the very beginning this game took much fan base complaints and molded this game into something fresh and exhilarating the graphics are something that can always improved upon but are dealing with the year old console switch graphical capabilities there are occasional glitches but they are few far between and doesn affect the playability can this series improve course but the game addicting spent almost hours just the first section exploring catching this game beautiful and makes want complete everything something the other previous games made boring 
266,the game masterpiece terms evolving the now previous pokemon formula the first chance and game freak has nailed every manner the game play immersive fun and addictive fully fledged into open world format that feels very refined and fresh and can taken very close what fans have always wanted the soundtrack one the best osts pokemon has ever received the graphics lack but means bad even grand many places the game nails every manner put forth and been completely blown away the quality may very well the pokemon fan dream game well the best pokemon videogame date 
267,the best mainline release the franchise hands down couldn have asked for more pokemon game since was kid this what envision the series looking like going forward absolutely awesome game thank you game freak this great base build please 
268,pokemon legends arceus was something get hyped right from the start when they teased the massive openworld makes this game really interesting discover more and more with the ability control the camera angle was great from sword and shield wild area but this game are free use this feature everywhere well the battles and while talking npcs some case really enjoy playing this game and spending hours and hours catching all really appriciate their effort this game now looking forward gamefreak next project

270,new fresh bold improvement everything this lovable rpg lovers beautiful open world fresh way battling and evolve pokemon just love best pokemon game ever living the lore 
271,great gameplay and battle mechanics changes hoping that this the direction pokemon going great job game freak 
272,perfect the game that wanted since play first pokemon game pokemon ruby 
273,should have given points even not perfect still willing give encouraging point very close the pokemon world imagined when was child but ten years late unfortunately can only take time play this game occasionally this busy age can maintain this level the future will like buy pokemon games for children 
274,the best and most refreshing pokemon game release very long time good makes going back the other pokemon games seem chore which fine with could use more content course but with that said definitely chance they took but with huge win 
275,this game deserves just for the volo fight alone but also comes with entire video game 
276,this salute all seasoned pokemon players that can still enjoyed new ones the story was great not stellar but that not the centre this game and sure the graphics could better but essentially playing tablet with thumbsticks what really shone this game was gameplay the controls and the feeling catching are natural that you can for hours and still not bored hope can expect more legends games the future this has been most enjoyed pokemon experience since the original dpp games 
277,the best most innovative pokémon game ever made almost the exact game was imagine when first started play pokémon kid great step for change the old formula for something new 
278,was intially sceptical the recent remakes and sword shield were bad but after some friend recomendation gave shot turns out this one the great one this game itself just good gold silver was back the day initially give but the more played the more liked this there plenty content this one and they adding new quests updates and yes some the terrain graphics are bad but the game fun doesn matter that much 
279,overall thoroughly enjoying pokémon legends arceus about hours and haven wanted stop playing like any pokémon game the first hour basically the tutorial little slow but that allow players all ages learn the mechanics the game others have said visually the game little lackluster looks like what would expect launch title for the switch look like graphics aside the game breath fresh air for the series opinion enjoying exploring the world learning the mechanics and doing everything there the game definitely taking time with the game and enjoying every minute read the reviews and think lot the ratings are trolls who watched the trailer and didn like the direction the game has taken please don listen the trolls but also don take the perfect scores too seriously and think the game perfect you pokémon fan fan open world games similar how monster hunter rise works then think this game worth taking look 
280,this probably the most unique entry into the pokemon series since its inception being able run around the world catching and running away from wild pokemon real treat and really gave the series fresh new spin can little weird times due the controls not being that fluid and can very clunky you trying switch specific item pokemon fight times but works very well the battle system similar but has its own quirks that separate from previous entries the lack abilities and held items now give type immunities such ground being immune electric and more importance these wild pokemon can have very high stats for their levels especially alpha pokemon who can overcome massive level advantage deal significant damage alot pokemon had unlearn alot standard pokemon battling tips that was not prepared for not bad per say but you might find yourself tough spot very quickly that level advantage you thought would make the difference for neutral pokemon who has special move that your pokemon weak too almost say this game would better experience for people not experienced with pokemon but recommend basically anyone who might interested the clunky controls and the usual poor framerate that comes with playing the switch aren too much hassle the end the day the game just fun and really hope they continue games like this the future 
281,break from standard tradition pokemon finally gets first truly open world game with plenty exploration and emphasis catching and researching pokemon the only downside could use some graphical polish 
282,lover pokémon but also someone who has grown tired the normal game format wasn even too excited when arceus was going released but usual got anyway because hoped would finally give the pokemon game was asking for and happy say really delivered having sunk hours into the game far still enjoying and for the first time since pokémon red actually want catch all this game perfect but the steps that game freak have taken bring pokémon into the current generation rpg are promising but saying that there still long way 
283,starts off little slow and the menus are mess also needs better story but the game play amazing love 
284,here have very good game with the twist gameplay been waiting for world interesting and progressive with the story but also gives you enough freedom you please very recommendable 
285,the best pokémon game least years could have better graphics but improvement over the past games 
286,this game solid probably the best pokemon game ever released the graphics are pretty sub par for 2022 but that stops mattering minutes into the game view haven had much fun playing new release quite while 
287,don believe the super low review scores from others that haven even played the game while there are issues legends arceus the biggest leap forward the franchise has seen yet resulting one the best games the franchise has offer 
288,the game really fun play addictive and has pleasant japanese vibe the introduction pretty long but not boring never been fan pokemon games but like this one because 3rd person has cute graphics and has interesting grind with quests but the game has its disadvantages lot people complain about graphics just fine and doesn disturb eyes the most awful thing the game opinion audio some sounds are way too junky compressed 
289,this game incredible been addicted since got remember kid playing outside with friends like were pokemon trainers pokemon legends arceus exactly what envisioned playing pokemon should like they seem have actually considered the kind game that people want when they think playing pokemon exploring finding them their natural habitats and everything just quick and fluid the gameplay loop explore catch rework team super refined and almost sad that didn get pokemon game like this much much earlier not all perfect though gamefreak simply doesn allocate nearly enough budget for their game development result this game visually looks like could have been the wii there was basically budget for cinematics and there much stuff that expressed text that characters are doing but just goes black screen because they didn actually animate that you know you think franchise that has one the most popular and long running series with would have the budget that not mention voice acting and orchestrated soundtrack which obviously they have for the series but enough the bad this game easily not only the pinnacle the series whole but game that nostalgia put aside deserves the records and accolades getting 
290,the most fun had playing pokemon game long time the graphics could have used more polish with more detail but overall isn bad the outrage over the ways encountering catching and battling seamless and intuitive and provide massive positive steps forward for the series future mainline pokemon games should look this game the bare minimum and baseline what should 
291,best pokemon game experience ever the quality life improvements new combat mechanics the open world areas the quest mission based progression reward system and the ability shift from exploration combat seamlessly truly make this breakthrough for the series 
292,everything said about the graphics true but you enjoy pokemon you are going love this game and spend hundreds hours 
293,great game never been this excited about playing pokemon since first played the third generation opinion this new formula should the future the franchise just didn give because believe the graphics little out date just little but that doesn affect the player experience all good job gamefreak 
294,the game uglybut great fun realy interesting and envolvingim loving itbut graphics 
295,graphics could better overall though the best foot forward gamefreak has had while great new mechanics and the flow gameplay incredible 
296,this surprisingly good the new gameplay loop really enjoyable feels amazing able explore the pokemon habitats being able quickly pick between pokemon and send them out whenever you want feels great gathering resources streamlined and doesn feel like chore the fact that battles take place the overworld and you don lose control your character also feels amazing and helps connecting the world and your team lot more the story also more developed and engaging than anything gamefreak has done the past some characters are bit too over the top but guess wouldn pokemon without that the presentation the biggest drawback the pokemon models look great and they are well animated the vfx also great you won disappointed with the way the moves look the textures however are absolutely horrible there lot pop and there this purple shader over everything for reason the frame rate also dips the mid twenties from time time especially during boss battles also voice acting which shame overall this the biggest step forward the franchise has ever made far the most enjoyable pokemon experience hope they bring much this possible into generation 
297,love what game freak tried with this gamethey need stop phasing out pokémon would add more variety 
298,didn expect much from just looking the previews the game thought would wait for critics come out didn expect succeed and yet did switch standards got the game one day after release and been addicted since then the core gameplay very fun very effective only complaints are that bit strange that you always have head back jubilife village before heading another zone also would love the combat perhaps just bit more interactive not that dislike the classical turn base stuff but maybe something paper mario esque hell even better like the tales series though that could asking for bit muchon the graphical side think people are bit harsh though compare this shin megami tensei the games run similar performance fps with the occasionnal stuter believe smtv looks better though not huge complaint here knowing the limitations the switch game still charming and doesn look too bad music great enjoying the themes game progression seems much more fast paced have never been huge fan the whole exp share thing but think they got right this time the game just seems more difficult that other pokemon games alpha pokemons aggro encounters writing this review with over hours for hope game freak build onto this further the pokémon franchise looking have great future finally wish they would had focused dev resources this and delayed bdsp years instead 
299,this game very fun whether you played any pokemon game before this the most important aspect for game and definitely delivers despite its flaws and subpar visuals that many are unhappy about 
300,good game pokemon pokemon game been looking forward since childhood 
301,this game shouldn even compared past titles this the most enjoyable experience had with pokémon game far say the best the franchise the battles styles make combat more complex and adds depth and welcome addition the story and gameplay breath fresh air breaking away from previous titles the moment opened the game and saw what this world had store for was grinning from ear ear having full control over the camera and having good camera that makes the game feel much better than sword and shields half baked wild area this game phenomenal and definitely worth try 
302,this game love letter those who enjoy pokemon and its lore don miss this game you are fan the games even with some comments that seen about the graphics and all the game runs fine coming from shin megami tensei which technical masterpiece its own pokémon legends arceus manages impress with the detail has for its fun mechanics and catch them all based nature one game not miss 
303,pokemon legends arceus without doubt the boldest and most ambitious entry the history the franchise setting out the beautiful region hisui this game caputres the same open air feeling nintendo was able achieve with breath the wild with emphasis capturing opposed battling this game takes all the best concepts let and combined them with their core franchise create truly unique experience all own the best element this bold new venture absolutely fantastic story while bit text heavy times this the first pokemon game gamefreak has made since black white with strong focus story and they without doubt knocked out the park with strong characters and emotional moments that moved unlike any pokemon game ever had before addition great story with fantastic characters the game absolutely beautiful and stunning explore sure the switch can only push graphics far and some the renders are far from perfect but the early hours playing found myself amazed and constantly thinking can believe this pokemon game the gameplay loop insanely addictive too explore capture explore more capture again and before you know you lost hours your life having blast with charming environments soothing music addictive gameplay and the exciting feeling encountering new pokemon very difficult not find yourself smiling every time you play could about the specific joys this game like the thrilling boss battles cutscenes increased shiny encounters crafting the thrill the hunt wonderful new hisuian forms and much more but keep brief possible this game feels like both the true return diamond pearl well the next big pokemon game all been waiting for have doubt this will serve the foundation for whole legends sub series and when think about this only being the beginning tremble with excitement think what can come next voice acting dare dream but for now back the wonderful addiction that pokemon legends arecus not perfect but beautiful start 
304,fun game havent had this much fun playing pokemon game years love the changes they made the only thing not fan the graphics seems abit plain either than that its very solid game 
305,best pokemon experience ever had far was everything always wanted and imagined the pokemon world one point from perfect for the terrible graphic 
306,finally feel pokémon back the right track legends arceus mix the new features from games like pokémon let pokémon sun moon and snap the main rpg gameplay that made the series success the result much more entertaining gameplay loop didn expect there many 242 pokémon species this game the visual great too the art style very charming and pick jagged lines over blurry vfx every time had the chance 
307,did pokemon give story where the point wasn become the best battler did pokemon aim make game that pleases all ages did pokemon revamp the battle system take different spin and did they incorporate boss fights the answer all these questions resounding yes wasn love with the game the start because expectations were low and the story straightforward and simple but while this game won earn any awards hidden gem that can confidently recommend any player who has ever had any interest pokemon the game blends pokemon snap with standard pokemon game adding strategic elements catching pokemon prosopportunities for strategywide arsenal things dosmooth gameplayconsthe graphics aren just below average can get the waylate game gets redundantwhen was playing botw couldn help but wish were pokemon game had little interest sneaking monsters kill them but the thought using the environment catch pokemon was thrilling had clue that game like legends arceus would come fruition that actually lot fun there always something earn money complete sidequests work the dex catch new pokemon strengthen your pokemon collect rare items and shiny hunt cannot stressed enough that you can switch activities whim that level cherrim trainer fought for literally game hours threw every kind ball the game got annoyed ran caught other pokemon succession and switched areas earn some money takes bit for you unlock every area but you can always return areas you unlocked strategy wise had the most fun playing this game than any other long time when went encounter flock ursaring each one was ten levels higher than strongest pokemon had try lure them out one time problem was luring them out too far lead interruptions from other pokemon like luxio luxray when finally managed isolate one they could still wipe team easily had develop strategy consistently defeat them was absolute blast and unexpected challenge fifty hours and the strategy remains however does get the point where you just chucking balls everything you see fill the dex minimizes the strategy the game and eliminates challenge and that impacts the fun love the font but the graphics really need attention not just rough around the edges there missed potential and there should more ways interact with the pokemon you caught literally work the graphics every department and you got something really special what makes this entry exciting the idea that pokemon might consider evolving from its roots something bigger and many people opinions including own something better definitely game worth reviewing 
308,this pokemon game better then the last like games not including ultra sun and moon that games post game and improvements made better game opinion this game opinion really fun for this game but for others can see being but you like pokemon want get into back into recommend this game the graphics are bad yeah but arent even that important nor will take from your experience this game its really addicting and definately worth playing 
309,the best pokemon game years completely tears the rules surrounding what pokemon game has and delivers fresh more logical take the series the story actually feels like some effort was put and the interactions with npcs are actually enjoyable this universe much more engaging people act like real people confronted with these terrifying creatures known pokemon actually feels like there point working the pokedex you educate people around the region what pokemon are this sudowoodo sad but plant maybe spraying with water pulse will help lol the battle system vastly improved well popping into battle much faster than the point that bet you play this and then back either those the first thing you notice also ability move around battle means during quick battles you can choose your attack and then start running before the battle even ends much fresher catching pokemon faster too you can catch them the normal way unless they run which happens lot you can sneak around and stealth his them with ball like the survivalist pokemon trainer you are the pokemon influence here works great imo makes you feel like pokemon are actually these wild creatures with habitats and temperaments finally just small thing but like how you can always run from battle never made sense that you couldn previous games outside these are the rules pokemon games arceus you just call you pokemon back and run away which much more realistic which sort encapsulates what like much about this game things just make way more sense within the context pokemon existing love and beg nintendo please make more this game very different from previous games though that may bother you although you one those people who like meme about pokemon making the same game year after year hope this doesn bother you cons the art really pretty but looks like the big screen just for basically nintendo hardware holding back what would undoubtedly better game was allowed spread its wings 
310,this genuinely the most fun have had playing pokemon game years get lost the wilds searching for new areas and alpha pokemon sidequests and satchels like all pokemon games parts the story itself are pretty predictable but there were aspects definitely didnt see coming genuinely loving this game far and glad see there still lots after the credits roll graphics could use some polishing the caves are pretty yeah but the graphics dont make the game for personally the gameplay feels smooth and love the different ride pokemon and crafting mechanics overall very fun game and hope they continue down this path 
311,finally something fresh gamefreak standards course hope they can really expand this type gameplay gen 
312,bad graphics but very good game lots new mechanics and changes the formular this the evolution pokemon needs edit now finished with the game and increasing the score from because the really awesome mounts swimming climbing and flying much fun 
313,this step the right direction loved this game after burning myself out with sword shield thought was done with pokemon games after ignoring but this game god had much fun 
314,honest review thought this game was going terrible held back from buying but recently bought after watching gameplay and fans loving played and was very surprised its the pokemon game all wanted 10years ago but never too late guess very addictive game ive thoroughly enjoyed much could easily sink 100 hours negatives for the lack online and the graphics voice acting and music also think the battle system needs move from turn based more free moving system but regardless all these faults has one the best pokemon games since gold silver for personally its step the right direction but has much improve honestly great game and anything sink 100hours high rating game 
315,first all don remember when was the last time enjoyed pokemon gsme this much hardcore pokefan this would game they mixed with the original formula miss gym battles elite four and even trainer battles don mind that not fully open world that could really overwhelming with lot pokemon and for the last come gamfreak put some effort the graphics the animations were cool the pokemon are cool but the terrain n64 
316,the game wanted for long the plot more mature and the world interesting finally story interested gameplay fun and make sense the story you have complete the pokedex and revive the village for reason that make sense the story grafic the reason score not still better than what tought but inferior compared other switch titles huge step the right direction for gamefreak can even forgive them for selling incomplete nerfed game with brilliant diamond shiny pearl 
317,the game would perfect wasn for the graphics also really slow start however past those two points they completely changed the game 
318,honestly what game this was completed the dex and everything that last boss fight agaisnt arceus was incredible and the final trainer battle was intense best pokemon game since gen and wasnt the same boring stale formula have had for the past years game not empty and full pokemon 
319,haven finished yet but played hours the first weekend the last time done that with game was probably kingdom hearts the ps2 this game doesn always look great but damn fun play actually fun catch pokemon again having blast alpha are fun mechanic they actually feel dangerous the game gets dark too actually mentioning death few times just hope they make this series because this damn cool had take point away for the graphics especially the water doesn look great but the pokemon themselves look great really don mind you kinda just forget about 
320,pokemon legends arceus interesting new take the pokemon series the game fun and well paced the cast characters are strong and interesting and the story satisfactory overall the world feels vibrant but some parts tend feel empty repetitive 
321,excellent game just needs voice acting coukd bever get into the older pokemon ganes because need game can walk around like this deffinatly reccomemded anyone who loves play adventure game with rog elements and anyone who loves pokemon this must buy 
322,definitely the best pokemon experience ever had literally the only issue have minor spoilers the ridable ursaluna sonic adventure had better mechanics for treasure hunting literally only used for the mission requirement and never touched again because how particular the controls are for 
323,hours around hours fun the game has terrible graphics you know everyone knows but also the sound design lackluster the story usual you need functional braincell understand but people enjoys minecraft the game amazing there many qols love you can catch every pokemon without needing someone else trade with you easily the best pokemon game you are fan you need try just wish there was more battling content 
324,finally have game that gamefreak have put some effort however does actually work minor spoilers you haven watched trailers warned first sitting sat there for hours straight giving this honest can put together fair review played all stream and said pros and cons there but here they are text for others read and decide they want purchase have now put hours can put together fair review overall yes this game worth and very impressed gamefreak took this risk and hope future games use this type system there are some things they could have done better which into first pokémon night could have more variety every map has the same pokémon night except few that are exclusive that map night most driffloons you find which annoying but during the day there variety each map only night lacking some side quests need some work they need more descriptive give you the maps name least some them give you quest where you have area but that name isn any map all someone would have mentioned the name but you have remember the map needs more little towns for immersivness you have people coming from other existing places your town however you never actually find those towns instead having random quests the maps pick you could have little towns you pick them from and then you could learn little more how those places operate the same time except you just hear all the places and never get see them which shame pokémon the wild could have behaviour characteristics get too close another pokémon they could argue with each other even fight have bidoofs collecting wood make dams beatifly landing trees and sucking the nectar just things give the pokémon more life they sleep night they don despawn and get replaced with night pokémon which does happen now why such great game system the open world style really suits this game and huge step forwards for the franchise being able choose try and catch pokémon right away battle great what even better being able move while battling this doesn anything but lets you look around and you annoy more than one pokémon you can end battling many enemies that are around you crafting now this actually lets you something with the open world style collect materials which you can find the ground get rewards for catching fainting pokemon you might think tedious thing but you don need craft you can just smash through the content however crafting does add little more for those that like this type thing collecting recipes and crafting those new recipe make fights easier the future mounts you can run fast break stuff swim fly and you can switch between them whenever you want with the pad and your currently your running mount and into water will automatically switch your swimming mount great addition gamefreak well done however wish you could actually fly around and fight flying pokémon the sky danger now you can actually faint from pokémon attacking you this could with being harder though very easy dodge pokémon attacks get away from them however the fear you actually fainting and loosing items you went out and crafted bought cool addition the game alpha pokémon are great addition too you can litterally throw your pokémon out anywhere and call them back you catch alpha pokémon you can compare size regular one you have choice either fight the wild pokémon catch them right off the bat even aggressive pokémon can approached with the correct items caught about alpha pokémon without battling them the side quests are both great and have their flaws the same time most the side quests have different styles quests have little story too them too but then around 5th side quests are just fill pokemons dex entry which too many opinion your planning finish all dex entries anyway you want the reward overall this game hard love that gamefreak went for risk and put much effort into new game rather than getting new 3ds game that slightly bigger map size this great direction for new pokémon games see this the botw the series this test see the audience enjoy this style game and then future will get more immersive maps maps will towns are going end having truly flawless game they continue this direction and don just use this style spin off games the future 
325,can say that the game has been really enjoyable far after hours game not game that breathtaking breath the wild but think that could steppingstone for the next pokemon game which might revolutionize its series game freak the right track give this for the fun had the way the graphic not that bad you don compare botw people just had way too high expectations for like expected this the botw level what the hell 
326,the most excited ever been see and catch zubat any pokémon game the new gameplay loop very addicting and there actual challenge catching some the pokémon and staying alive the only con have for this game the graphics can buggy times but mean what you expect from oversized cell phone bottom line the game very fun and holding interest compared the last mainline pokémon titles 
327,pokemon legends arceus amazing new direction for this series and honestly thousand times better than sword and shield were opinion sure enjoyed sword but legends amazing feels like pokemon meets breath the wild sort that maybe pokemon meets monster hunter rise with how you multiple massive and open areas explore and hunt things down also just much fun graphics look alright but they leagues better than sword and shield the gameplay solid and much more like what was hoping for when saw the original reveal trailer love this game but kinda tough avoid getting wrecked high level alpha pokemon you wander too far and would say least make save datas for pokemon let game sword shield and brilliant diamond shining pearl for some free clothing items and two bonus quests involving mythical pokemon the postgame and also fantastic that favorite starter pokemon cyndaquil starter this game but digress just pick the game for yourself and find out how good for yourself 
328,not perfect game but man this far the best pokemon game released over ten years 
329,this one the first times pokemon game has captured that wonder felt playing first game when was young was astounded how many risks gamefreak has finally taken genuinly hope that this type pokemon game gets polished more and new template for the series moving forward however the graphics are fact pretty awful while usually that doesn mean anything personally somehow this game makes notice more and the pop pretty anoying don really understand how games like breath the wild can launch title and look way more amazing due clever art style tricks make run flawlessly the switch limited hardware but assume that after this game success there will more effort put into these aspects the next arceus like game unfortunately the graphics hold back bit but rather have annoying graphic problems and huge rework pokémon than another bland mainline copy paste pokémon game 
330,pros this game has some the most addictive and well designed gameplay loops have played pokémon game the game allows you curious and encourages more often than not and feels very rewarding for just exploring the map adds many new quality life updates and changes like the battle mechanics are expanded these changes are long overdue for the pokémon and works really well the games favor the music amazing and pleasing especially battles and just wandering around the open world the story this time around surprisingly decent and kept invested the pokémon formula changed for the better and really works the games favor also the actual pokémon have actual personality and very refreshing see cons honestly this game really ugly looking most times and the graphics are just not par even for switch game there lot jank the controls and takes away from the experience the game does have certain lack polish that sure will somewhat fixed but release the polish lack thereof definitely noticeableconclusion all the problems mentioned are problem and wish game freak was given perhaps few more months iron things out even though that didn happen pokémon legends arceus one the most well designed and compelling pokémon games ever and able overcome those shortcomings this game the game pokémon fans have been waiting for years for and for the first time years think the future the franchise looking bright 
331,was worried about the graphics and world being lifeless and empty but there simply too much and addictive gameplay loop either notice much care pokedex completion varied and engaging completionists will happily busy pokemon themselves never looked better music phenomenal seamless transition from open world battles engaging story graphical artifacts are genuinely distracting times flickering pop ins and glitching grass flat out ruin some moments 
332,start with the obvious downsides the graphics are not good even considering switch game just looks unpolished and unfinished the story nothing special and about what you expect from pokemon game however enjoyed playing the changes the stale formula makes nice and new experience new fighting options stale trainer fodder fights and fun being researcher the action sequences give nice break from the normal more monotone battles would have given was more polished and had more content but satisfied for now 
333,the best pokemon game far had not enjoyed any pokemon game since years ago but this time really enjoy 
334,the best pokemon game have ever played all ever wanted growing this game not perfect but provides excellent stepping stone for future games this style hope gamefreak sticks with this style game times was painfully obvious this was the devs first time attempting make game like this however the gameplay absolutely addicting and the overworld pokemon are simply too cool pass this game 
335,such amazing game hope pokémon games continue this direction the future you can get lost for hours the world simply just wandering around and catching pokémon the first time actually interested completing the pokédex graphics are the only let down opinion 
336,never liked pokemon games after the tutorial would always remove the game because was bored technically pokémon legend arceus first pokémon that have enjoyed life played hours and still long way from the game really advance what pokémon the graphics leave lot desired but that doesn stop the game from being very entertaining you are someone very focused graphics not buy but you are fan the games wanted change the pokémon saga buy and play this game because promise you won disappointed 
337,best pokémon game long time cuts down the nauseating text boxes you have acknowledge the previous games 
338,you are someone who does ever has liked pokemon you will like this game you are someone who literally only cares about graphics you will not like this game 
339,not fan pokemon until now game amazing love all music gameplay every body should enjoy 
340,the first pokemon game genuinely enjoyed and wanted finish since big fan monster hunter wonder that why love the game much sequel dlc with all new pokemon and some better textures would being this 
341,been playing pokemon games since gen enjoyed every pokemon game since then pokemon legends arceus great video game perhaps one the best switch not the absolute best but not the best pokemon game per say first off graphically looks fine pokemon games have never been visually impressive and personally don see whole lot difference between this game graphically and something like breath the wild the sounds are great the music sound track hits hard and the game itself makes good use sound effects sometimes you can kind tell where pokemon might just listening helped lot was much easier tell when pokemon was about attack performance fine the game fps but consistent fps personally while prefer fps don actually mind fps long consistent and the framerate here good enough for course though this pokemon game gameplay what really matters this game very fun and very addictive relaxing out looking for pokemon the boss battles need bit work but generally had fun with this game very addictive don have whole lot free time due work and stuff the fact that played about hours this game just the last week that been out says lot the crafting system nice idea but needs bit work really good lot the resources you gather are only good for one two specific items and that seems like bit waste would nice you had think about which resources you wanted use for which items and each resource had few different uses you have resources that are very specifically for certain types pokeballs resources that are very specific for certain types medicine etc gets point where you simply just don collect certain resources because you simply have good use for them the pokemon themselves however what really matters battling them fun and switching between the overworld and the battles themselves has never been better think the move pool lacking noticed lot moves seem have been taken out the game and while some ways that helps balance the battles makes difficult get the right moves for certain pokemon and type coverage becomes difficult speaking variety pokemon where this game needs lot work the pokedex only about 250 pokemon the smallest ever had outside remakes most those pokemon are from sinnoh which makes sense given the story however bit disappointing see such limited number pokemon this type enviornment there was about pokemon that seem available every area and with many pokemon are there are this simply shouldn the case know people have complaints about sword and shield but this something they really got right with the wild area sword and shield disappointing see how limited the selection pokemon here 400 500 pokemon size pokedex would make lot more sense here the story very good not the absolute best story ever gotten pokemon but easily makes the top only real complaint that there much too much handholding through the story other pokemon games this makes sense given how linear the games are the first place here however makes lot less sense given the open world enviornments all really want explore the enviornment and they almost seem force the story upon you instead like the rewards for pokedex completion and completion the game itself you this game gives the most insentive keep going out all the pokemon games and easily gives the best rewards you get money for pokedex completion and find myself continuing catch many pokemon can can get more money get more items and clothes wish there were more clothing options but the ones that are there are good there also way more shiny hunting options than usual which nice for people who enjoy that sort thing all all pokemon legends arceus very good game but you are looking pick your first pokemon game recommend sword and shield first and then checking this out afterwards this easily the better game but sword and shield the better pokemon experience where you get see and more pokemon related stuff say both games are 100 percent must plays for anyone interested pokemon pokemon legends arceus very good groundwork for future games and certainly plan following see what they continue with the pokemon legends series think with bit refinement and just generally taking everything bit farther this very well could the future main line pokemon games and that excites 
342,little liberation that this game offers fluidity play and freedom movement are good graphic performances are agony will impossible for return episode that would take the gameplay and the speed the old games the scenario good are role play are more researcher than trainer and logical with agoal completing pokédex the rating quite high because have fun and appreciate the initiative change good old whiskey served good old bidet hope for legends that would push all this higher and finally use the processor this switch 
343,pokemon back and better then ever the gameplay refreshing but the story needs some work that really only problem with this game this solid evidence that graphics does not measure how good game 
344,really amazing game overall love the new mechanics and would amazing see these implemented mainline pokémon games not have the spin off with legends and keep going has said the graphics aren par which real shame and could have really done with voice actors feel like something they need invest going forward but more than makes for them with its sheer amazing gameplay overall they done amazing job 
345,played around hours far and can honestly say something unique and special nintendo have done yet again take critic reviews with pinch salt they highlight the technical aspects far too much for what like many great nintendo games they come with their performance quirks however this does not all get the way the many hours fun which can had this game thoroughly recommend this game anyone who has switch even your not the biggest pokemon fan this game great fun packed with content and great step forward for nintendo and pokemon only thing ask for more this dlc and future games 
346,everything that was expecting from this game was delivered and even more true that still sins with questionable graphics and performance but the gameplay good the models the monsters and the new animations are really amazing and the story actually really good the last part specially overall spectacular experience and the best pokemon game since fifth gen looking foward see what this brings the table the mainline games gen could something incredible 
347,the most fun had with pokemon game since the first gen instead just doing the quests out there grinding the pokedex for hours without being bored the game would but the graphics are playstation level some pokemon the background have like fps and you can see pokemon only you are right front them but this game shows gameplay graphic 
348,new experience pokémon and amazing cant let playing exelent work for nintendo 
349,after hours finally finished the game fully completing the pokédex and facing the fight pokemon legends arceus has been wild ride massive step forward for the series which hope see going forward played every single pokemon game since frlg and grew with the series and never felt more emboldened since then catching pokemon has never been easier yet still more depth battles are fun and closer what the anime portrays the world like full environmental storytelling you looking for and characters that you recognise from other games but with little twists along the way making use settings legends arceus also takes some more steps forward terms the behind the scenes mechanics that think would good take forward into the future competitively and also makes better for casual players not punishing you too hard you beat legendaries rare spawns there some occasional pop and sometimes the models look bit slow when distance but that been only real problem with this game but barring that the gameplay loop amazing and scarily addictive absolutely recommend pokemon legends arceus anyone 
350,the renewal pokémon has been made needed movement world has expected things and some new unique mechanics such launching the ball mobility the combat trainer and many more also combines perfectly the action game with the turns games the graphics are nice for nintendo switch and fit the game the main history could have been longer one two señorial more copies lots things dragon quest monters joker which was only released japan and advanced pokémon still one monsters development though pokémon needed this way enjoyable could improve but really masterpiece this kind games 
351,despite the graphical issues that pokemon games now have these days don kid yourselves this game the most pokemon feel ever and most fun had since gen which was the last one actually bothered buy this game easily gonna take many hours for beat because love taking slowly and filling all tasks can before progressing the story great for chilling and just having good time plus the music and characters designs are great this time around definitely give try you just care about graphics play something xbox then nobody cares 
352,pokémon always amazing but this time game freak really tried innovate and opinion worked the only problem with the game being the bad graphics 
353,what can said except good job nintendo this may not the perfect game for people but does one nicely done job and being one the best pokemon game years listen the positive and negative reviews fully recommend 
354,absolutely loved this game been playing non stop for the past few days and can say that experienced enough the game give true heartfelt review legends arceus pokémon game incredible refreshing new take the tired old pokémon formula while also streamlining many features originating from the older games stand alone game however this game still good but can sing praise about legends without taking about the graphical quality handheld mode the graphics look perfectly fine and most people probably could get used within matter minutes however docked the graphical issues are made much more apparent with the game looking like something from the gamecube wii era short legends arceus great game and for those still the fence about highly recommend you try sooner later 
355,someone who has had minimal interest pokémon games this point yeah this the real deal rough around the edges with somewhat poor graphics and minor graphical glitches but shines times too with decent character models and pretty sunsets the gameplay itself compulsive the story pleasingly dark and the soundtrack better than has any right impressed 
356,hadn had much fun with pokèmon game such long time loved the game lot great and fluid gameplay loved all the new concepts that were included the graphics need lot polish hope future games improve that but keep and improve this gameplay this the way 
357,best game have played since botw the final boss was epic and love point because the graphics are trash 
358,not the prettiest switch game however far pokémon games this far the best the kick the the franchise needed and have been glued since launch the battle system bit janky and feel needs some polish but refreshing while have been exploring every bit real estate can touch still feel the open world definitely needs little bit more life too much space with not lot going you probably reading this and wondering why giving even though thrown nothing but negatives out that simply because the game fun feel like fun hasn been part pokémon game while love being chased down random aggro mons love the fact that there actual story the ability craft and farm also nice touch being able swap pokémon move the fly great quality life feature say what you want about this game but step the right direction there plenty they did wrong but plenty also done right hope see this legends series continue amazing game 
359,love this game step the right direction and any pokemon fan will love while think the people complaining about graphics generally are being bit dramatic the game poorly optimized and does feel like needs some tuning pokemon can clip through the environment and certain textures looking you water and shadows cause crazy pixelation everything around like horrible pixelation but don focus that the game has heart much heart literally breath the wild meets pokemon with little bit animal crossing crafting and fire emblem garach mach monestary worth your time and money and sure hell hope get another pokemon legends game mew perhaps celebi 
360,everybody knows that this game looks like but man look the gameplay amazing really fun great pokemon game 
361,breath fresh air for the franchise and far the best switch pokemon game 
362,easily the most fun had playing pokemon game yet love exploring the world this game like almost all the new forms old pokemon think the new pokemon are really cool honestly for pokemon game the story pretty good and the game play loop while different pretty fun and makes catching pokemon very fun the game isn really focused fighting and collecting gym badges instead you build the first pokedex sounds like grueling but easier make progress than you think and feels good reach new ranks and new areas the ride pokemon this game are very fun use and feel well integrated into the design the environment speaking the environment really good looking the graphics look very polished and honestly one the best looking pokemon games this definitely one not favorite game the series really only complaint that your own pokemon can follow you the world and sometimes trying get your rank can feel little tedious 
363,awesome game with brand new gameplay improvement and great sound although the graphic still not good hope will monimated for goty award tga 2022 
364,addicted this game pokémon has not been this good since like gen fully recommend getting this game amazing much fun the new mechanics are great just much fun 
365,game freak delivered everything shown the trailer and boss battles are most fun they amazed 4th one was bit difficult expect graphics everything good and music very good makes forget about the graphics the game isn perfect but good should say one the best gams pokemon 
366,the game can better the graphics are but new mecanics and the pokedex awesome this the wey pkmn has follow 
367,best game years the fact makes some purists mad shows that this game will affect the whole franchise for years come and better the experience whole due lack accessibility settings 
368,yes the game not perfect the world badly needs filling but sincerely hope future pkmn games keep this style game revamp was sorely needed and all would need happier with this game multiplayer battles and some more interesting content explore the world 
369,was very jaded when comes the pokemon franchise simply because gamefreak fed with sub par overpriced games for the last years that also contained design choices that were simply put baffling the continous targeting younger and younger audience made the games feel like shallow not fleshed out mash adventures this why had much trouble accepting this but here legends arceus very decent game story right the bat you have story that more akin gen5 one where people talk about actually dying not mention that you get send down earth god himself the stakes often seem high throughout the story like the point when the bandit sisters snag growlithe and you have rescue the characters themselves are mostly fleshed out sometimes like the case the male female counterpart the player they could have done more but all all the individual characters motivations and behavior make sense dfficulty not too difficult not too easy opinion they could habe bumped the difficulty the game quite bit more but decent level difficulty where you can just mash until the credits pop which makes far more enjoyable especially when you out your way fight higher level alphas becomes lot more challenging caught alpha ninetales when mons were around level gameplay this game hands down the biggest departure from the usual formula and does what does pretty good the new fighting style different and refreshing the fact that you can just run around during fights and even get hit both the enemies and your own attacks very nice touch the crafting fun side activity that gives you enough incentive collect most the stuff along your way which makes for more coherent experience love that you can just run into higher level areas and even fight the mons there felt extremely threatening run into that alpha snorlax level right the start the game graphics yeah they are the pokemon themselves look clean honest the attack animations also look decent and oftentimes even straight amazing like hyper beam hydro pump blizzard but the terrain looks like some intern did blender the grass looks worse than mario and the cliff walls look like they even glitch out from time time yeah graphics are not the most important thing the world but would have expected more than ps2 graphics rest the sidequests are fun and diverse yeah the core they are often similar and some them are boring well but the games usually sells them you like they arent which makes them feel less repetitive you even have one where you catch guaranteed shiny which you even get keep you can put all your pokemon out their balls jubilife and they even interact with one another such nuances never made into the game they were implement lazy way but just makes feel much more realistic that way all all legends arceus good game and worth the money you will get very breath the wild like feeling where you oftentimes just run around doing anything but the main story quest 
370,graphics are terrible but wildly fun game spite that love everything about the updated catching 
371,was looking all the negative reviews for this game and all them were just complaining about the graphics the difficulty the game definitely more difficult than some the most recent games but not too difficult when faint lose don feel like unfair because mostly own fault and the graphics are actually step compared pokémon sword and shield although they are step they aren too great times sometimes you will see parts hills the distance randomly load right front you even sometimes tree pokémon rare occasions overall the graphics give low but every other aspect the game phenomenal and big step compared previous entries the series and why rating this game out this game truly great game and big step compared previous games especially comparing this game pokémon brilliant diamond and shining pearl and anyone who thinks that this game somehow worse just bad the other games completely wrong this game gives amazing changes and some small changes you may not recognize your first time playing through the game you can tell they put lot thought and detail into many different aspects the game there are some problems far the graphics and nintendo switch optimization but other than that this game wonderful and the best time had playing pokémon game years 
372,huge step great direction cant fault the game this time genuinely dont mind the graphics find them stylised granted the frame rate far away pokemon low but unsure this issue with the switch hardware being incredibly weak its programing issue the game fun first and foremost someone whos played every single pokemon game ever release when they released its breath fresh air come away from old clunky and boring system yes having abilitys would been preferred yes get the competitive side being weak frustrating for some people but for others who just want solid non competitive pokemon game for the first time many years this satisfys that itch excited see what the pokemon company next and hope god they build this system and retire the old one 
373,this game huge leap for its franchise and just fun and good pokémon game you start with good and deservedly long tutorial you are long die hard fan the pokémon franchise you immediately notice the fundamental changes that were made you actually get good introduction into the new movement and the catching system you are someone that some way unbiased and pick the game because looks interesting just good unlike many pokémon games before this sword shield this game actually has depth and story that would let adults enjoy world which pokémon are wild people are afraid them and don even dare touch them you not come prepared act rashly you can very well lose your life from npc standpoint not exaggeration say that this the situation people the hisui region are facing the tutorial doesn start with you yet again saving the professor from life and death situation choosing your starter and off you like graphically there lot room for improvement textures are somewhat presentable playing handheld mode eases the pain but once you plug into the dock and hook that thing you just notice the many rather unattractive aspects this game sadly has offer being already the visual points the attack animations are crisp and look very good npc finally look more like actual people with more added facial expressions less repetitive movements look sun and moon bad example and imo somewhat better dialogue general most character designs are creative stick out and are memorable their personalities are not nearly one sided what are used the latest games that even group thieves you encounter after couple hours gameplay explains that they just steal order survive there just more reasoning behind the tasks and conversations you are faced with the multiplayer you can even call that minuscule that you would forget there even such thing would say that actually adds immersion that you are mostly alone these open world levels but would still gladly take improvement the current solution just picking other players lost items for slight reward trainer battles are very scarce way makes sense since there shouldn many trainers around anyway speaking logically doesn lack fighting general since you this more than enough with other wild pokémon but there slight lack the tiny bit competitiveness you would get defeating the elite four would like see more options choose and challenge certain npcs for battle there actually training ground the village that story wise maybe used only couple times the time have played there was only one battle there real fighting interaction you can challenge someone the music good the sound design has gotten better you actually hear echo your pokémons screams when fighting ruins and the engaging gameplay with its new fundamentals stealthily sneaking pokémon order catch them actual trainer vulnerability and the other already mentioned things just fun and that what this game fun safe say that this level lore depth atmosphere and gameplay and design should the new standard for this franchise 
374,you put aside your feelings the obvious graphical issues has the game play loop and mechanics feel legitimately great this first ahead something this big and the mechanics were nailed down now they gotta start working doing modern time line pokemon game with gyms and frontier but with these kinds open world environments and smooth out the graphics spent hours getting lost and trying discover different areas with different pokemon and different ways encounter and approach them 
375,the games innovative gameplay loop really engaging and the world building pokemon lore exemplary the game ugly but still has epic scenery and feels like huge step forward 
376,what refreshing shift for such beloved franchise can wait see where they take this 
377,dont let the dumb youtubers fool you this game amazing and the rough draft for all future pokemon games 
378,great game very addictive and fun not because graphics can improved lot 
379,the game has very good concept behind the core mechanics felt polished and seems game freak really did their homework even though technical limitations the game coupled with blurry and weird textures think the game was still very playable enjoyed lot 
380,there are some room for improvement this game but this game made progress 
381,good start big change the pokemon game the system made very exciting worth playing for anyone with nintendo switch pokemon fan 
382,just think neat perfect not long shot however subjective very fun game and shouldn necessarily pushed aside just for its looks 
383,this game great really like the world and how been set these games and some areas genuinely look really nice the gameplay also quite fun but also streamlined many aspects and navigating through hisui feels fresh and quite enjoyable sure has some obvious downsides the game like graphics but feels more like lack proper lighting and lackluster art direction where the artstyles the world itself and the characters kind clash but being honest this franchise has needed something drastically new for long time and while this isn the most revolutionary thing ever this exact what the series needs this game probably not for everyone either considering strictly single player experience about completing the pokedex which had never bothered before previous games but for some reason find addicting this game think people ought buy encourage game freak that yes need more innovation and care put into future titles 
384,disclaimer you care lot about graphics and not gameplay this isn the game for you giving the game just because the graphics are lacking shallow have been playing pokemon since diamond and pearl the and this the most fun had with pokemon game since this mostly due the well structured gameplay loop there are lots ways you can approach battling and catching pokemon and this freedom really defines the entire game instead pressing button run away from battle you can just actually run away you can move during battle giving you any perspective you like once you get past the tutorial you are free explore large area with lots danger and excitement besides that every mechanic implemented streamlined perfection the gameplay much needed and revolutionary step the pokemon franchise the gameplay earned itself valid point critique that the graphics are lacking don get wrong there are some moments where the game looked pretty but overall very very mediocre the textures are often compared the wii era and let tell you they not far off furthermore there the usual pop trees and rocks which isn always noticeable but very jarring when you notice luckily the pokemon themselves not pop heavily they are usually seen from further away the expense lower frame rate the pop has been improved from earlier titles like pokemon sword and shield overall the graphics leave lot desired though does add enough game overall therefore rate this department was pleasantly surprised the sound design the game though didn expect anything else from the gamefreak veteran ichinose the soundscapes legends arceus take the immersion new level for the series the world pokemon has never felt more alive favorite sounds are those the player movement rolling sprinting crouching the grass throwing pokeball massive fan this amount detail the soundtracks the game are subtle and reminds one zelda breath the wild there are some beautiful renditions there older soundtracks the sinnoh region one favorite being jubilife village the games sound earned itself people asked for better animations and they got there are lot new animations for the pokemon themselves the moves the npcs and much more gamefreak outdid themselves this department really the little things that sold the animations pokemon actually make eye contact the trainer can seen showing actual emotions after heavy battle the player often wipes off some sweat the player can get hit pokemon moves and you can see the player retreat pokemon their pokeball sure they small things but never seen before the pokemon franchise recurring theme pokemon legends arceus there are some moments where gamefreak could done more better said least something the game still fades black cutscenes where two characters are supposed interact with each other which just comes across lazy easy technique avoid animating something and for real time events that acceptable however are talking about cutscenes here gamefreak cutscenes are outdated and sad they didn improve them for this game there are lots things love the animation department but not perfect therefore the animations are for conclude pokemon legends arceus game worth your time whether you are new the franchise veteran everything combined this game 
385,what imagined pokemon when was child playing gen3 emerald firered leafgreen graphics are not good but they have never been strength pokemon games given the limited time develop this game game freak has done good job 
386,the best pokemon game ever played that game what pokemon franchise needed since the begining course the graphics horrible but game freak think left the comfort area for the first time 
387,pokemon legends arceus truly amazing game has some fantastic mechanics the closest ever got the dream pokemon game and definitely step forward the franchise obviously not perfect game the graphics are just awful and there fps inconsistent but the game fun many ways that the flaws are just secondary 
388,honest this isn the absolute best game ever however don put too far away from the best ever certainly shakes core aspects what pokemon game can but even doing you still feel definitely pokemon game you liked the ability catch pokemon without fighting them like let pikachu and let eevee you woll love this game will say best game from pokemon since coming over switch 
389,first pokémon game great gameplay and performance like the style the graphics but the draw distance and pop ins are bummers 
390,this pretty great game honestly after the cute but shallow let games and the awful sword shield games this very refreshing has very addicting gameplay loop everything fast and snappy and besides the first hour the game lets you play pretty freely graphical issues aside mostly docked mode handheld looks pretty good fully recommend buying this you old pokemon fan that fell out all with the recent games 
391,you growth playing pokemon you will like much don pay attention the comments the haters graphics are not important here 
392,the game not perfect especially the graphics but you look past the graphics one the best pokémon games and probably the best game this year also stay mad verlisify 
393,good game good mechanics not very good graphics but you enjoy anyway 
394,this new concept pokemon wonderful the monster hunter like style broght new fresh air pokemon franchise this game has nice gameplay and magnific soundtrack would recomend this game every pokemo fab 
395,great game very depth pokemon experience reamly makes you feel like your the pokemon master just the visual could use some tuning pls fix the water combat and pokeball animation 
396,the best pokemon game history can rate with because some graphical issues that are minor problem but very clear that the game needs some updates fix the popping 
397,cons first not enough pokemon battles there less trainer battles than ever now that you can even avoid wild battles just throwing your ball you get use your hard crafted team less than ever there should more trainer battles make for this needs more puzzles needs more dungeons multilevel caves temples etc the stone query was good but needs more areas like that more levels ladders dumbed down pokemon move variety abilities pros the definitive correct next step for pokemon different overworld pkm sizes seamless battle overworld transition rider pokemon good job but also consider allowing other flying leg leg climb types just strap your straddle arcenine luxray for example side missions are good step overworld exploration done very well plenty and get lost doing 
398,astounded like this game pokemon died for around black and white but just blown away how much this surprised and impressed 
399,had make account just let people know ignore the negative reviews those people obviously didn play the game and probably want some more sword and shield type games 
400,super fun makes more hopeful for the future pokemon only wish they would put more time into the games and could easily been 
401,opinion this game the best pokemon experience ever created has addictively fun gameplay and the crazy part that seems like was made test prototype the things missing are the traditional pokemon tropes like gym battles and even random trainer battles those two things existed this game would definitely the access being able fully evolve your pokemon switch out moves sets the fly and easy understand system should staple the series moving forward this new bar that the franchise will have beat going forward 
402,wonderful new direction for the regular pokémon games and certainly welcome one yes graphics could better but they not undermine the core gameplay loop have not had any framerate issues either the difficulty spikes sometimes which was unexpected for current gen pokémon game the story accessible for its audience 
403,tbh usually play every pokémon game matter what even meh but this game something else haven felt something from pokémon since gale darkness and colosseum this game gives those vibes but better even tho the graphics aren the best this what wanted when came open world pokémon game hope gamefreak knows that want more games this style with obviously some improvements but this something else only hours and not even half way yet love catching them all and doing the side quests that actually matter such good game and excited see what comes later 
404,new refreshing experience for the franchise and definitely the most fun had with pokemon years while the technical department certainly lacking graphics and model optimizations that doesn take from the first experience open map pokemon world the characters lore and story are solid the level design smart and diverse and the combat system fast fun and immersive pray that tpc will take this the new direction for their games even has secondary series games with more time work and optimization this game could easily been 
405,personally love the game and the premise but the graphics tend catch eye most the times when playing video game this game they are not the best the game beautiful its own ways but only you are paying attention what near you 
406,not pokemon breath the wild but breath fresh air this series was need shakeup and this was exactly what needed hoping pokemon legends will continue down this trend experimental pokemon games with rpg elements because this has been blast far only knock from giving the lack polish some areas but easily overlooked excited for the future this franchise 
407,pretty good gameonly con see the way you catch pokémon the water not man graphics didn care about but think could better 
408,this way forward for future pokemon games other pokemon game has given the sense wonder and excitement that pla has this the closest pokemon has ever come being dream game this the first time felt like was fully immersed pokemon world there much attention detail and the battle animations have finally got reached respectable quality the game rough around the edges and has the smallest lineup pokemon moves but without doubt this game should benchmark for all future pokemon main series titles 
409,fantastic game honestly the entirety the game probably only because some mechanics are janky and the graphics could much better but happy about the direction pokemon going with this rounding instead down make more like this please 
410,hours still main story fun times far story about enjoyable any other pokemon game gameplay feels smooth and you think you can something probably possible personally not the most picky graphics since the switch only console wasn really bother and found quite soothing look even for extended runs did but yes nothing remarkable groundbreaking that department 
411,just can give since the graphics are ugly times its not optimized and there more popping this game than any other tried with that out the way and also the rather long tutorial this dream come true the gameplay very well designed for you whatever you like more investigating completing the pokédex gather resources train battle for sub missions remain attached the main quest all magnificently incorporated gameplay cycle that gonna consume you the variety creatures and their animations are superb the story the best have today matching with pokémon fans will love doubt about new comers might have hard time the beginning but when the grinds starts guarantee that will not stop thanks gamefreak 
412,story wise this has some the best writing gamefreak has done since the characters are fleshed out without the 2000 sun and moon cutscenes every second and plays very smoothly gameplay definitely hit miss you either hate love since there are very few battles and most the gameplay just battling this solid please don work dlc for this gamefreak and give some nice graphics patches inside 
413,fresh new direction for pokemon great base for games come the open world the battle system and the boss battles felt great certainly lacked polish the graphics department and was too easy beat miss the puzzles and difficulty from other games overall its good that nintendo are trying new things 
414,yeah graphics arent amazing but the game and finally have new pokemon direction still grinding game like all the past pokemon games will still feel familiar the past games 
415,100 right direction for this game series the release remastered version pearl and diamond set the stage for this game really well the game itself honestly addicting say the least and your pokémon actually feel like you interact with them compared other games hopefully they stick this track and make more games like this you will definitely want try this game for yourself 
416,very fun game story was very compelling you like the story generation games battling has changed little and makes the experience even more fun very good start for the legends spinoff series and cant wait see more games like this from pokemon franchise enjoyed every single hour put into the game 
417,just amazing blend all the recent features that game freak had previously added plus the open world areas feels wicked just refreshing way play pokemon and enjoyable game overall 
418,about hours and still did not finished this game its absolutely perfect new contents new mechanics the map really great despite lack cities only one next generation can still better doing the same 
419,although there are few drawbacks such graphic issue and main story shortage this game shows satisfiable appearance which pokemon mainstream games can have afterwards 
420,the complaints have been made the graphics don need add disagree about the color palette though quite like the muted watercolor feel besides that complaint which does not take away from the gameplay all just the overall experience the game great most fun had playing pokémon game since the originals serious feels new and fresh everything love about pokémon with new features and mechanics wonderful 
421,graphically has quite few issues there doubt about that there are times were pokemon will spawn and absolutely jagged movement and its not really fun look that being said this the most fun have had pokemon games since what pokemon platinum pokemon fan would have fun with most pokemon games because they were about pokemon legends arceus the other hand has enjoying the game because genuinely just fun experience all round the game want complete the dex want catch everything see want play for hours end without any stoppages has completely revolutionized the pokemon series really have been breath fresh air genuinely hope that game freak and the pokemon company pick from here and further improve the way pokemon games are going 
422,well worth the money best pokemon gaming experience date cannot wait see what else gamefreak and nintendo plans with the pokemon franchise grows from here 
423,this the best pokémon game out the entire series and hope they take all the features from the old games and merge them into this one not upset that they didn have all the older games features this one since they are clearly testing the waters for moving the franchise forward really would like see mystery trades more than anything and not sure the game yet because maybe haven unlocked them yet suppose possible that could add features later but rather just have them the next game that has this same gameplay loop and includes the features old games like held items tms and hms and abilities please for the love god make game that has the complete pokédex and fight animations just hire extra people make the models and animations for christs sake please 
424,the best pokémon game that gamefreak had ever producedwould there were online battles 
425,amazing game very unexpected you don really care about graphics and you are pokémon fan you need try 
426,game mechanics are really good and something really refreshing comparison the stale main series really feels little like pokemon breath the wild gameplay smooth and engaging dynamic tomes character controls feel responsive pokemon variety somewhat lacking but the sheer number research requirements complete each mon differs from known catch and forget the world not good looking hoped but good enough traverse with pleasure plot little meh but hey there one not limited catch them all beat team place random word here beat the league this good enough for conclusion despite shortcomings really really love this game getting bored easly playing games and this one after hours keeps entertained and can wait play some more 
427,welcome change from the series long running formula with mostly open world exploring added non combat catching and main quest side quest journal while there plenty room for improvement what given very enjoyable experience grinding for exp game loop replaced with research tasks giving you reason fight and catch various pokemon with different set goals for each pokemon species this also plays into ranking system that replace gym badges hours and suspect will enjoy hours more score based enjoyment from title and not what think should have been included improved 
428,pokémon legends arceus breath fresh air for the franchise after playing generations game that all feel like the last one the new catching mechanic makes catching pokémon fun again and not some long and annoying prosses catch the pokémon you want your team your trying fill the pokedex the more open game makes feel like you have more freedom the past games and that huge plus for even its not completely open world like botw the difficulty this game also something love because not only battling regular wild pokémon bit challenge but the new alpha and noble pokémon can shot almost any member your team you are not crazy over leveled also dodging pokémon the game also challenge blacked out times from pokémon attacking promise you you are not paying attention make sure pokémon don see you and multiple pokémon are attacking mass you will have problems hours and still haven beaten the noble boss fight but far the story actually feels like story compared swsh but those games were still good could all day about everything love about this game but still have say that this game not perfect the graphics could lot better but they are not god awful like others say and the framerate pokemon from far away just bad but nothing bad when battle close them also wish that could skip cutscenes like swsh cuz there lot dialog want replay this game get ready mash through the talking the game but even though the game has its problems they don out weigh all the good things this game and hope game freak takes the base this game and expand with good graphical features because this game the best pokémon game far 
429,this easily favourite pokemon game ever open world the perfect genre for pokemon and that the way should always hopefully game freak keep the good work 
430,despite the egregious graphics and empty world the gameplay amazing and entertaining 
431,great for pokémon game much needed refresh for the franchise graphics could use few coats paint the environments pokémon animations are solid and look good tons collect and the world feels massive not boring your pokémon fan game freak really stepped there game pun intended would like see all future pokémon games using this template and continuing what was laid here please game freak don back the old format move using what you built here your the fence just give shot really fun 
432,best game far about pokemon hope one day see pokemon red blue this style 
433,nice game with fresh new elements the graphic could better but the game play lot fun 
434,for this the second best entry into the pokemon series although disclaimer only played each the mainline games and remakes and let that counts separate thing arceus has been absolute favourite since played blue for the first time the 90s and this new game was beaten out nostalgia and fond memories only honest the minimalistic art style reminiscent older japanese artwork beautiful and moving take simplistic world that supports the engaging core mechanics true that not beautiful some more recent games however for clear that this not what arceus sets out when talk about open world games the narrative often becomes about that world and the interactions with that world the character and story arceus doesn set out have you move mountains within the world but instead exist part theorised greater whole much like the thesis the game story how exist humans within this greater world filled with potentially terrifying pokemon who are default stronger than are the game asks who are compared each other and who are compared these creatures rather than who are compared the world for the beauty further than skin deep and the graphical minimalism the world supports this greatly arceus gives stage often lesser used pokemon asks you think about your pokemon journey further than who the strongest and puts the exploration and mystery back the genre loved and sincerely hope they produce more this vein highly recommend 
435,this game love this game now favorite pokémon game like the world building and the chosen pokémon for the areas they are great and makes sense some people don like that the pokémon have fixed spots where they can spawn but like that way isn difficult fill the pokédex especially like that you need different things complete the pokédex entree refreshing new all the new concept something what pokémon really needed this the first important step but hopefully not the last step there are many things improve especially the graphics and the distant view but for people who don care about graphics only about the game play this great game there aren very much fights but there are some what like but this can totally understand this game plays time when isn common that everyone has pokémon the most fights are easy but sometimes there are hard fights especially the after story about the boss pokémon the games like that concept some them are really easy especially the first but not all two them were really hard and one them have died two times which don sound like much but play very much dark souls and this game especially important dodge and the dodge role pla exactly the same there during the role you are for short time invincible you dodge exactly when the enemy attacking overall like this game great and does very much fun 
436,great game the wild area can polished but this game certainly leading the franchise new and exciting direction 
437,great game much needed change for the series the best pokémon game since gold and silver they just need improve the graphics bit for the next version this 
438,this game full really really good ideas from the open world with tons things the new capture mechanics the likable characters this doesn feel like pokemon game and that good thing this game first step better direction for pokemon and really hope gamefreak builds upon these ideas and polishes the game future pokemon games 
439,beautiful reborn for pokemon every one can play and love beginner fan big fan like nice story beautiful soundground easy lran how play for must have for every switch player 
440,longtime fan very happy with this game while has flaws mostly visuals and performance brings the series back initial ideas and executes them well the gameplay while different very fun and incentivizes using every pokemon the pokemon finally have variety animations that gives them each much personality found myself liking pokemon never thought twice about before the catching mechanics are great and while the new battle mechanics are not ideal for competitive they are welcome changes switch things they took this formula added online back into and fixed some things would the perfect pokemon game for 
441,favourite pokémon game ever legends arceus feels refreshing after all the incredibly linear pokémon games the past the wild area was step the right direction but this entire leap some parts are still frustrating like necessary 1v3 battles and repetitive star rank farming progress but even those aren that bad can think anything off the top head that was added into this that noticeable downgrade from previous games completely understand why some people might not like this game which completely fine but want make clear that not praising the game just because mostly everyone else went into this with very little information didn watch trailers other content about this before was released was not very hyped for this game before played but very much enjoyed the experience the game has been stuck mind every time unable play always sticks the back head waiting get back home play this has turned into tradition for this point not quite through this game yet and not very critical person when comes media but still wanted add take this you ask which you shouldn this game definitely worth especially you pokémon fan 
442,the game very cool brother got for digitally and sure the tutorial the lengthy side but with the new mechanics its justified the story very cool and arceus aka god gives you phone and like how they have shiny pokemon spawn the overworld with sound with they even added something for the black and white fans they added ingo and even his subway like lines and got nice smile they even added the subway theme and redid which was nice touch this could legends saving the remakes 
443,new gameplay elements are amazing good story environments and biomes are diverse battles and encounters are slightly more difficult than previous games only major issue graphics 
444,could not bear play pokémon game since the games were just endless tutorial hells with childish storylines that did not challenge any form whatsoever but this this finally dream come true roaming through ancient japan with pokémons battling through somewhat challenging fights and feeling like trainer explorer rather than kindergardener killing spree just much fun love every aspect even exactly because not fully polished 
445,such great jump into gameplay course has noticiable problems related graphics popping such disaster but terms joy and fun hope this game sets the guideline for the future pokémon 
446,finally they are making jump out their normal formula and worked perfectly the only con the graphics but really love the game 
447,for everyone complaining about the visuals and graphics apparently don remember that this game coming one the most critically low points for pokemon and gamefreak the game too graphical and has substance they are torn for laziness gameplay the game has tons content but graphics they are torn for laziness graphical fidelity this game graphics are enough make this highly successful look into what could become another mainline adventure game the series you take the core component out the game the pokemon this still very well upheld adventure game its own right this game has many firsts for the series unreal this the first pokemon game where feel like bringing the whole concept pokemon gotta catch all really the idea that drives this game forward this the first game where feel that pokemon are actually magical beautiful and dangerous creatures never run into the tall grass without pokemon defend you the mantra that hounded the intro every single game this point actually felt being chased lightning cat would absolutely terrifying you were alone this game makes you actually feel like you are one the first people tame wild weird and wonderful world filled realistically with pokemon short pokemon never has and never will the pinnacle graphical innovation what this game does and shows that you can have whole lot fun with being lean mean pokeball and food throwing machine with enough world and graphics satisfy the itch for long time come 
448,massive improvement and filled with quality life features that make the game much quicker pick and enjoy has graphical glitches nothing too game breaking and while the graphics are rather passable the gameplay and complete push for effort makes this game very enjoyable experience recommend for the pokémon fan who felt burned sword and shield 
449,refreshing and unique pokémon game great mechanics story and for the first time you want complete the pokedex has certain level complexity and would great that they add battles with friends best pokémon game opinion 
450,love this game many qol features added the more mature tone the story the tangible danger the world gathering crafting very curious what this game means for the future the franchise very hopeful though 
451,most fun pokemon game ever played gameplay amazing adds lot features for different playstyles which are enjoyable everyone and give more realistic feels for our creatures story and missions are simple but enjoyable even for adult public graphics should given more effort the future but given the style the art doesn look too bad one would think having playing around hours highly recommend this 
452,pros lots pokemon faster and more fun catching more than just battle open world exploring more engaging than previous titles more personalization than other gamesconts graphics were obviously impacted switch hardware game designed poorly terms efficiency they removed abilities story sub par 
453,this what long term pokémon fans have been waiting for hard rate the game solely its performance quality more about the innovation and the effort and what this will mean for the future the franchise the game its own isn perfect but believe everything needed 
454,besides graphics and slow start everything else great haven played game without realising gone for while now love the game loop 
455,the perfect pokémon game know needed with the only downside being its graphics excellent qol improvements animations and combat system exploring hisui one the best activities ever found videogames 
456,very fun and enjoyable game solid game loop only gripe the blackscreens when character does something and just see black screen with sound effect 
457,addicting because poor graphic and missing voice acting dialogues are lil bit childish but this pokemon game soo thought will bored with all that catching stuff nad many tasks pokedex but extremely addicting the best pokemon game switch 
458,just amazing gamefreak has finally started modernize the pokemon formula and incredible haven had more fun with game couple years 
459,this game not maybe not even but feel the need overrate because all the hate seeing great game and most important great pokemon game which honestly haven seen long while definitely worth time and enjoying every second even completing the pokedex without following the main story because don want end 100 recommend 
460,best pokémon ever played but why there still audio for the cut scenes 
461,what breath fresh air for franchise that felt like was drowning hope gamefreak goes forward with full head steam with this new gameplay the story itself also lot more competent and enjoyable than sword shield really hope gen similar this with more emphasis graphical fidelity and interacting with your pokémon 
462,have been playing pokemon since the gold and silver days even though have always been hardcore fan was slowly losing interest the series due the never changing nature the games the past years and behold gamefreak finally decides step into unknown territories agree the graphics are something that definitely look like they still belong the previous decade but feel that they have more than made for with the gameplay hope this sets the milestone for all future pokemon games come 
463,unique and great approach old classic pokémon there nice balance between fresh and new game mechanics combined with familiar themes great see that there isn strong emphasis fighting but more catching and exploring which feels more tune with the theme pokémon mix between breath wild monster hunter and pokémon 
464,wouldn fair review just gave this game perfect because does have faults but all honesty even with those faults this still pretty amazing game its own right and hope for the future this series they keep this style gameplay this the first game since bw2 where actually enjoyed playing all the way through despite its issues that why gave 
465,finally fun pokémon game after years stale games pokémon finally changed their formula and for the better the concept may not sound too interesting first but building your own team has never been this fun even far saying that the game gets better and better you progress zones get bigger pokémon get smarter and you can finally assemble the team with the pokémon you want always wanted alakazam team and was limited the outdated trade mechanic but now can finally use one how refreshing this game would wasn for the graphics especially disspointed certain aquatic zone that looks completely hideous and that rushed through get the next zone luckily the zone following was way better looking and fun also don like the water mechanic very much think way less fun catch pokémon the water than land the story nothing special but not necessarily bad voice acting also kinda makes you cringe along the weird animations during the cutscenes some lag here and there but nothing that will alter the gameplay the difficulty the game quite easy sword and shield were and dark souls were this would but you can also choose fight pokémon that are much stronger than your team and try catch them which adds optional difficulty overall amazing game mediocre graphics considering botw had similar style and looked miles better despite coming out years prior this game where gameplay everything and the rest pretty much just there functional 
466,great game was really into pokemon during the gameboy and advanced but grew out the franchise until sword and shield which was ish but left thinking was done with these games decided take chance this new one anyways and having blast and complete rejuvenated interestes the series going forward 
467,pokémon legends arceus about the way being perfect pokémon game certainly not the most amazing game look but the gameplay fun enough make for the lack graphical fidelity great addition the franchise and hope they continue build this concept 
468,only thing keeping from graphics still not understand how some things made into final cut pokemon just going tree randomly the outline your character during some backgrounds distance renderings etc however this the most fun have had with pokemon game years bdsp shouldve been this great story and characters not see how bacto tradutional pokemon games after this gen and remakes have high bar pass hope gets outside help with graphics 
469,best pokemon game ever made game does lot things well however there are few small problems the graphics and not enough sex 
470,pali_critic 100list favourite games 5best pokemon game all time 
471,fun new adventure with pokemon worth play buttons are easy remember 
472,definitely one favorite pokémon games the new battle mechanics are breath fresh air and has sense similarity the old battle mechanics the world big with lots different pokémon find certain parts the region the visuals are lacking but the performance the switch makes for this and the story great 
473,honestly was really skeptical when saw the leaks about catching multiple pokémon complete pokédex pages but when actually played the game was very natural truly enjoyed playing this title like haven with the franchise for years this super fun the graphics are still wonky but opinion doesn significantly hinder experience and even meme able some point refreshing game 
474,the game design brilliant probably the most fun ever had playing through the game the fast pace batlle and catch mechanics are the things the hold the idea together they were slow would incredibly boring complete the pokedex but quite enjoyable when you can catch and battle matter seconds with intro unnecessary dialogue for the fact that the game not truly open world not negative would nice fly over all the regions yes but did seem necessary completing the pokedex being the main goal the game its great tried play the game without looking for tips and managed catch every regular mon minus spiritomb and evolving some them more this later the thrill when found cleffa grotle and munchlax the last needed was one the best years playing videogames think 237 242 decent number pokemon have the game the max they could have gone believe 300 more than that would slog get arceus the last one need was cherubi which imagined that would one the trees where you can find cherrim which found two while going through the first part but delayed because kind boring going back the village over and over again the one negative thing have say about the pokedex arceus mechanic that stupid lock arceus behind some mechanics that are almost impossible find your own killed the overkqwil the game gives that but would never find that you need use the same mechanic 20x times the same goes wyrdeer not sure you cand find the wild but ursaluna the worst one tried every item discarding the ones you use other pokemon imagined you needed the peat block but for insane you need evolve during full moon which quite rare insane because players will need check guides for which bad also impossible find manaphy you don have diamond and pearl which don but not necessary get arceus the spiritomb mechanic for there not particular impossible wisp find and while doing the other stuff managed find out 108 had done everything else and was clocking hours decided check guide get arceus but you dedicate time seach for them while doing other stuff said not bad the research mechanic good while gets boring the end the game makes you cycle your team and train almost every pokemon which first for the franchise usually plan team ahead and use max and you can get research level really fast with almost all them the few you don actually nice challenge because they are rarer pokemon and you need make the most every encounter you have not going through the mass outbreaks and distortions but they are nice change pace and are very helpful completing your dex the bosses are major win simply battling high level pokemon the alpha mechanic makes some battles really tough but introducing different approach made the game really fresh for and the battles were really tough and satisfying after managed get through palkia was great boss battle and the one traditional trainer trainer you get the end game was really nice understand that some people may wanted more trainer battles but didn seem necessary for but the best new thing easily the riding mechanic switching wyrdeer basculegion and braviary great very smooth experience and may very well the best movement mechanic video game history not exaggerating being that good the game never feels empty played almost all the praised triple open world games and even though there much more the screen they usually have more boring parts you never need spend more than seconds get from pokemon which great 
475,the game breath fresh air into the overdone pokémon formula the new way completing the pokédex make the process more interesting compared catching and forgetting about the pokémon the graphics are down side and need lot improvement opinion graphics are less important when compared gameplay the part don like the overuse voiceless dialogue the story interesting compared previous entries but over run with boring dialogue overall the game excellent step that pokémon has needed for long time 
476,the breath fresh air this franchise always needed cannot wait see more pokemon games using this same formula good job game freak 
477,and the pokémon series has been disappointment since 2000 looked gameplay videos and decided that doesn look good enough try brother said was must play pokémon game because all been waiting for since 1997 told him would wait and get the next one actually bought for and haven stopped playing the first day played stayed till 4am haven done that years this game legit the real deal super fun you your and you used like pokémon and you have been disappointed with the series recommend this game pokémon back baby 
478,definitely best pokémon game played loooooong time spent hours finish the game 
479,big fan pokemon since was kid and the games that nintendo makes truly awesome rpg style and have say was kind effy this one but after playing and finishing its one many the best truly everything they did right and cannot wait reset character again and all over again the reason gave because pokemon gold and silver will always favorite 
480,writing this have put over hours into this game finishing the main story catching tons pokemon and doing many side quests can and must say nit been addicted game like this since first played spider man for the ps4 legends arcues fact the definitive pokemon experience recent the pokemon franchise has become very stale games with many half baked games removal fan favourite mechanics and some barely decent graphics arcues while not the craziest game graphically legends gonna save pokemon from further mediocrity story fun and quite interesting while not mind blowing will have genuine moments surprise excitement sadness and fun while some characters are quite stale the ones any importance feel very genuine game play spectacular this the game gamepley wise what wanted pokemon become since all played our first games catching pokemon the wild extremely rewarding battles are fun with agile style and string style being fun integration and something wish would become apart the mainline series found genuinely change the fights with getting more chances attack after another exhilarating and your opponent attacking multiple times while enraging you know most time something you could have avoided with the right tactics the graphics are pretty good all round the world fun and nice however clash artistic stylisation and over all world building causes things become flat and lesser than intended the glitches too while only experienced one fell that mentioning glitches needed this review some have reported man glitches being common occurrence for them and all who read this should cautious such legends arceus the direction pokemon heading while isn the main series games hopeful that aspects this game into the main games and excited see more regions the past most anticipated being legends game set kalos galar and unova would the most incredible ones play opinion you want this game get you ever want get into pokemon come back buy this game while there issues way these affect the overall grand experience too much other than when get stuck the water once lol 
481,breathe fresh air the gameplay top notch and engaging although there should have been hard mode 60fps would have made the experience way better well 
482,just fun run around and catch pokémon and discover different pokémon different regions the macanics work great and tough the frame rate isn always the best pokémon far away the game looks great overall accept some the cut scenes 
483,probably one the most refreshing games gamefreak has done long time indulging and the gameplay absolutely amazing most the characters are very rememberable especially the clan leaders lot people complain about the graphics but honest the only graphics that really look bad the environment besides that looks amazing the character models are really well done and the pokemon look very alive 
484,just amazing loved the lore and new catch system graphic quality doesn matter game like this and stays fps stable 
485,very addictive game can stop finishing the researches pokémon you liked catching new pokémon more than battling the main series you will love this game side missions where simple sometimes that the only bad side the game 
486,very good game pokemon legends arceus like step forwards from pokemon sword and shield you can explore little more freely and the graphics look slightly better and that step they took seems very successful for them haven finished the game like hours but looks very promising 
487,loving this game about and half hours not going give any spoilers but the game does get funner and you able travel more and faster you play was really considering trading selling this game after first two hours the reason for and not perfect score simply due the unnecessary dialogue the game which gets very annoying you just trying out there explore and catch level your pokémon understand part the story but they could have limited all the text saving from mashing the button and skimming through not trying sit there for hour reading through what the npc has say for certain quest would have been better there was some sort voice acting which would actually bring interest the story aside from this game really fun and rewarding just like older pokémon games love the battling adds bit more strategy now with agile strong moves catching pokémon also quite fun and provides some sort achievement catching the same pokémon more than once could have been perfect game still the best pokémon game released the switch 
488,really conflicted this game has lot negatives missing pokémon held back for dlc meaningless characters dull story absolutely abysmal graphics when docked and played these are all issues that kill the spot games and yet absolutely love pokémon legends arceus just unsure whether for objective reasons extremely subjective ones yes while all the above negatives are true the gameplay loop real time catching pokémon the let series combined with battling and moderately increased difficulty level improving elements introduced sword and shield makes the actual moment moment experience extremely satisfying pokémon fan this what been waiting for since first played blue the 90s but that where the subjectivity comes because think much more critical never heard pokémon and went into this game fresh game freak deserve praise for taking chances and moving the franchise exciting new direction but really needs stressed just how bad this game actually looks all for gameplay over visuals but there line the sand where just comes across downright lazy from the developers there excuse for the terrible textures that would make gamecube title blush one particular scene volcano almost vomit inducing how choppy the textures are this isn indie studio this multi million dollar franchise that can and should doing better even with the switch hardware taken into consideration other aspects the game such the invincibility frame dodge and roll dark souls lite boss battles and the tacked crafting system there simply give more purpose the open world inverted commas much needed here not really open world such are not offensively bad fantastically brilliant and represent opportunity move the series forward more the future missed the gym battle system well honest and hope that makes return future games flaws aside this the best freshest pokémon title since probably platinum years ago can markedly improved honestly don remember the name single character and finished playing half hour ago truly awful but the strength its gameplay loop enough give hearty recommendation and definitely enough get excited about future games the franchise 
489,complete reinvent the pokémon formula much needed breath fresh air mechanics are smooth and fun pokémon feel more alive than ever but graphics are human character animations need work solid 
490,for pokemon was decline the last few entries decline not because actually got worse but because after all these years you think they could improve these games much more arceus almost exactly the big improvement was always hoping for only almost because technical standpoint this game always rather disappointing think all know that gameplay the most important thing and arceus does deliver that front but can lie often wonder how much better these games could they wouldn held back nintendo hardware 
491,pokémon legends arceustoo much storyi love pokemon legends the idea open world pokemon game where you explore areas hide tall grass and catch pokemon battle them real time more than could have ever hoped for pokemon game but let tell you the story just gets the way ask what happens couldn tell you painstakingly boring and just the way essentially you fall from the sky theres giant rift that you have close some pokemon are going crazy you gotta fix and course fill the pokedex and now were talking now were the good part catching them all pokemon legends takes little over hours roll credits however thre are still about hours post credits gathering all the legendaries for the true ending don think youre done essentially you into open area there are pokemon catch and gather info battling this fills your pokedex and course makes your party stronger you through the story and ther incentive actually seeking new pokeomon out and ctaching them with your hand crafted pokeballs that right theres super simple crafting mechanic here youl lgather materials you explore and earn them after battles you use these materials craft potions and pokeballs unlocking new recipes you fill the pokedex its addicting building your roster only for the boring story get the way was skipping through everything honestly couldn care less what was going didn care any side missions nothing made care about anything other than going out and catching them all and really wish this was more the focus just let explore own pace have crazy hiding spot for rare pokemon that what want not lame bioms and checking bak the villiage but its fine still had fun despite the game contstantly throwing speed bumps and that ultimately biggest complaint felt like was chain the whole time compared the freedom feel from mainline pokemon game and also battles there are rarely any pokemon battles with others this world which probably explained the boring story didn care about but still let down building team for what just catch pokemon but the end each story chunk there boss battle well and these are awful you just throw bags sand them and dodge their attacks super repetitive would rather just had straight pokebattle pokemon legend has lot going against the lame boss battles the lack trainer battles and the god awful story dragging down the pacing this game but you better believed loved the moments was set free hunt and catch there are secrets uncover the battling system fun you even keep all your moves your pokemon learn and can switch them out anytime youd like which love allowing you really play around with move sets prepare for certain battles would love see this series take off give pokémon legends arceusa 
492,takes about hour get into after that its very fun cant put the game down sometimes probably the best pokemon game ever 
493,this has got the most fun have had with pokemon game many many years here some background for anyone who cares got pokemon yellow after played little red cousin loaned loved and played though times was young and stupid and had erased the game mistake few times because wanted experience the beginning the game played little silver before friend wanted his copy back when diamond and pearl came out the got back the series after had taken time away from for while enjoyed pearl and had completed the game week and played for few more then tried playing the games that came after played through black and had some fun couldn even get myself finish black played and beat over weekend and didn touch again sun was boring and never finished let pikachu was fun but couldn hold old man attention gave sword because was massive let down and after being someone who started playing the series 2000 was just kinda done with the repetitiveness the franchise when say the most fun have had with pokemon game long time not for lack trying even though never touch after that weekend always intended return because enjoyed any rate this isn franchise review review the new game game that has thinking about when not playing game that got roll out bed the eve 35th birthday and toss loads hours into and talk endlessly wife about when wasn playing the only reason won rate this game over there are still problems with these problems don mean don love the because relaxes mind repetition also frustrates with that very repetitive nature the fact that have spent hours working with one pokemon and still haven completed dex entry highlights massive shortcoming with the game most things need repeated times and that bit excessive book much love this game not sure ever finish single dex entry also the story while good feels like bulked out characters repeating the same few story points over and over point that when happens just kinda skip the dialogue until something new being said don need read where have come from and what did hours ago over and over nauseam that the tutorial this game horribly long and handholding then get the graphics boy the graphics honestly don care they look fine for the most part sure there bit clipping here and there water and grass can look bit outdated but really really don care often find beautiful look and while think they could have done better perhaps hid the graphics behind cell shading like botw did fine with them enjoy the game and the end the day that what looking for video game enjoyment have played way too many games with stunning visuals and substance whatsoever have played games with awesome stories but horrible controls that force stop just want fun and find this game very fun even when bit tedious 
494,finally got the pokemon game wished for don get wrong has flaws but finally gamefreak listened and tried something new and should least give them credit for that and let them know that the change and direction the game good great foundation what come what could better and should addressed either for new game even dlc the graphics obviously more diverse pokemon behaviour more rich open world with more interesting viewpoints sorting options for the pokemon boxes maybe biulding villages from the groundup the wild like taburasa breath the wild kind way tame the wildernessthe gameplayloop just feels very rewarding and much fun with little more polish future games the franchise will reach new heights already looking forward pokemon legends something like this definitetly play this game you have the chance 
495,nice games really love the new gameplay mechanics the graphics not really good but its fine 
496,this game great had amazing time playing the game the mechanics kept entertained through the whole game while not perfect and needs some polish parts still highly recommend this game 
497,breath the wild meets pokemon but with bit monster hunter mixed and love this the closest been open world pokemon game that daydreamed about since was kid arceus delivers pokemon snap levels environmental immersion mainline rpg you will encounter pokemon walking swimming flying around their natural habitats instead randomly encountering something while blindly walking through tall grass you can summon your own pokemon gather berries mine shards and engage wild pokemon all within few steps without waiting for flow stopping animations and transitions truly like playing simulation the anime issues that had most bothersome might the fact that you have fast travel back the hub city order the next zone like monster hunter makes the world feel lot smaller since just bunch disconnected environments instead huge continent also mounts the hub city makes traveling drag now for minor issues some the sound effects are clearly ripped from botw such the male character sounding exactly like link when tucks and rolls maybe was meant callback but personally wish they didn recycle assets like that the graphics are also little rough around the edges here and there some things like rocks and trees disappear you slightly turn the camera and the game sometimes draws pokemon its max spawn distance but animates them like fps which makes them look bizarre against the more smooth and lively world closer you the hardware struggling this just don draw the pokemon that far anyways give this out rough around the edges parts but this definitely pokemon formula want them polish and perfect don think able stomach the old style pokemon games again nintendo can somehow cram more modern setting with pokemon centers cities etc and open world pokemon walking about onto the little switch cartridge absolutely perfect may possible that the switch may not have the horsepower truly get the next level though 
498,despite the world not being fully open nothing wrong but botw fully open with better drawing distances and draw distance being terrible legends arceus the best pokemon game played long time since gen has tons content more than are used sadly but nothing compared other rpgs like skyrim and such story fairly long didn rush and took around hours would like see the same game but jhoto with access the kanto region and the full national dex not modern jhoto nor ancient jhoto regular gen jhoto couple cities multiple towns with huge routes catch pokemon still playing the game haven fully captured all legendaries and hours but already finished main story and post game story only missing secondary missions the story meh decent forgot talk about that but yeah nothing special compared mystery dungeon but its better than some recent pokemon games tho 
499,pokémon fan the late 1990s can honestly say that pokémon legends arceus well worth your time play and well yes some people might turned away the art style the game that game freak chose with not gonna judge you for that for personally the art style looks pretty good the pokémon looks great and the world looks vast and open but had give criticism have say that they should brought over voice acting including pikachu and eevee voice actors but other than that did really like the game that why giving pokémon legends arceus everything wanted pokémon game and more and yes did surpassed expectations but held back voice acting hopefully game freak decides fix that sometime the future 
500,after couple years frustrating choices gamefreak can finally say got excellent game our hands all though the game could have used another year development feels work graphics and environments that tend feel empty can say the gameplay makes well for 
501,well not pokemon fan went yesterday local store buy monster hunter rise and then when was paying they told also wanted take pokemon acreus that had released couple days back personally never played pokemon game before and thought give try first impression was not good honest and the reason for knocking couple points form the score that the graphics and presentation are bad for 2022 released game lets honest felt like game released previous gen music also very very generic and just serviceable well the sound effects having said that just kept playing and the game has some special charm the controls are good the environments are but its great see the little pokemon just running around and doing stuff and you trying capture them battle them far hooked its definitely enjoyable game and now want level and use all the pokemons that have captured honestly its good game with terrible graphics but you kind get used them havent even had time open monster hunter rise nor finish metroid dread sure you will enjoy this game 
502,while graphics can leave lot desired pokémon legends arceus gameplay has been retooled for much more smooth and engaging experience moving away from the traditional rpg format the game feels more like modern open world game akin breath the wild feel that this game represents significant leap for pokémon whole drawing closer the pokémon game that always dreamed the game not without its graphical issues however they aren significant enough hamper the gameplay overall would certainly recommend this game those looking for open world pokémon experience things like open world catching and battling pokémon the fly battles occur the environment not arenasthings don like unfinished feeling the graphics with low quality textures and aggressive pop star progression can feel like grind times 
503,pokémon meets zelda and loving this new style open world exploration looks great opinion plays well very addicting has occasional hick ups small bugs and glitches but nothing that affects the core gameplay experience 
504,game freak finally tried this time this was major step the right direction for the franchise after decades stagnation far have put roughly hours into the game and still loving the novelty catching and battling pokemon open world setting still feels fresh after all these hours and can see myself playing this game for hundreds hours have played every single pokemon game since the original diamond and pearl and can confidently say that this the best pokemon game have played long time game freak have finally managed make the pokemon game all wanted since were kids the pros gameplay better than ever and fits seemlessly open world gameplay loop addicting and rewarding feels like more mature game with higher difficulty maps only get better after the first area ambience music beautiful and immersive the cons graphics could have been better the game was given just few more months better than sword and shield but still has long way story bland starting with the negatives the game rough around the edges and game freak games weren rushed they could have taken few more months polish and make look even better this goes for the too pokemon are often just sitting around doing nothing luckily depending the pokemon they will react differerntly seeing you some will get aggressive and chase you some will run away from you and some won care all unfortunately even the most aggressive pokemon are extremely easy run away from and don present much threat certainly step from the lifeless pokemon from sword and shield but with second entry hope see pokemon acting uniquely within their own habitats similar pokemon snap lastly found myself ignoring lot the main story couldn get engaged with and preferring explore and side quests instead while the graphics and storytelling could use some improvement apparent that game freak spent lot more time the more important aspect this game the gameplay gameplay king legends arceus and easily the most addicted been pokemon game since was kid everything very seemless the open world setting they finally ditched the time consuming and dated battle screens and loading screens between areas this game feels like actually belongs the switch unlike the awfully outdated sword and shield the game loop very addicting you into the open fields collect resources craft items which will help you your journey you catch many pokemon you can complete your pokedex most importantly pokemon has long suffered from the criticism that too easy while this game isn hard any stretch does feel like the game has matured for older audiences quite bit noticed pokemon battles are usually lot more difficult the game longer warns you which pokemon your opponent sending out beforehand and the generally seems lot smarter when attacking you pokemon got knocked out frequently the first area obsidian fieldlands bit bland and may not the best first impression for gamers but fortunately after the first area the maps get significantly more interesting the biomes change swamplands coastlands clifflands snowy mountains all with unique ways traverse them the game continuously gives you new pokemon help you get around the music adds key element what makes exploring much fun the ambience music this game beautiful and adds just that extra bit immersion when exploring especially for players diamond and pearl even the remakes the music often remixed versions the old soundtracks sinnoh and visiting old places and seeing them realized open world such the lakes makes for very nostalgic throwback all all the closest switch games can compare this mix between breath the wild and monster hunter rise has the style and presentation the former with the addicting gameplay mechanics similar the latter this game strong and pray that game freak keeps this new formula and expands would very disappointing see them back the old style games after this 
505,loved this game was very different from the original formula but always nice try new ones they right and this one does the first pokémon game chronologically and the story very nice also enjoyed the gameplay lot the formula breaks from the typical battle after battle and personally found that really good for this spin off highly recommend 
506,really liked the game vote because the game takes too long let you play like open world textures are ass but can say this really fun game and the animations combat are insanely good 
507,give this least the concept great the openworld aspects are good and gameplay fresh and unusual for pokemon game showing how the pokemon line can outgrow from the gameboy era definitely positive way would wish for the next generation become full grown open world title with non linear story many side quests but legends arceus good step that direction but gamefreak please improve the graphics the switch system not that powerful but can really more when you look other games like zelda even titles like the witcher but still gameplay wins out 
508,have been really enjoying the game far big minus the graphics they should polished game more make look more clean and beautiful for that reason wouldn mind later release date overall this game really taking pokemon games new and fresh direction and hope next pokemon game even better and please gamefreak for your next time hire some voice actors 
509,most fun had pokemon game since was child gen yeah the graphics are little disappointing for 2022 game but the gameplay really promising please keep going this direction gamefreak 
510,pretty solid experience not perfect and the gameplay fun although bit repetitive times but the atmosphere super chill and can challenging when you least expect not for everyone but actually feels like effort was put into this one the early game the mon variety little shallow but gets much better you put the same level pokemon emerald not masterpiece like heartgold soulsilver but has charm and style 
511,what the franchise needed addictive can stop playing and getting all pokémon but the graphics kinda sucks for game made the richest brand out there good job game freak but update your graphics don care how many ppl tell you pokémon not about the graphics but when your developers are the top money makers you have excuses 
512,very fun and can lose myself exploring the areas pokemon legends arceus refreshing take the series and excited see where from here 
513,many long term fans will agree that the last time got exceptionally great pokemon experience was when black and white were released after that while the games were far from bad back then they never quite reached the same heights enter 2019 pokemon sword and shield were desaster they were rushed product devoid any meaningful content the point were felt downright cynical continued massive commercial success was the point were gave any hope ever having another good pokemon experience what didn expect was that game freak would then complete 180 and deliver this game definitely flawed but that you can tell they were really passionate about the graphics suck big time but what this game does provide highly addicting feedback loop immersive ways catch and interact with pokemon interactable overworld crafting epic optional boss battles ability based progression well contextualized side quest system worthwhile story etc this the future the franchise then gosh prayers have been heard pokemon saved and couldn happier great 
514,you looking for the greatest pokémon game ever made pokémon legends arceus not while the game very fun and refreshing like all the games before eventually grows feel too repetitive and unfun the gameplay loop gather resources catch pokémon complete research tasks and repeat this gameplay loop for the first hours very fun and addicting but the end the game does not feel there enough variety within the core loop keep you engaged likewise the side quests the game are pretty typical and unengaging which huge bummer for those who like complete game extra content the boss battles the game are super fun while you still battle these fights you also have trainer dodge enemy attacks almost bullet hell like way although they aren too difficult they add change pace the game main loop and rewards players for thinking their feet overall pokémon legends arceus quite fun game that suffers from sense burnout that many pokémon games before have made feel 
515,this game very rough around the edges terms graphics this game does not looks very bad frank but you can look past that you find this really fun game and definite step the right direction for pokémon 
516,the gameplay fun and refreshing however the graphics are terrible and the level design absolutely uninspired even though the game flawed many ways the gameplay loop very addictive and makes for the experience always hoped for pokémon game for first real departure from its standard all its flaws are acceptable gameplaywise hope the new mechanics will get improved and will implemented future iterations the mainline series however game freak and nintendo should also improve their lazy graphics and level design for their future games because those are huge disappointment and are unacceptable for any aaa game 2022 and onward simply breaks the immersion 
517,someone who played pokemon since gen kid wanted see how this new installment stood previous ones well opinion lifelong pokemon fan the short version this enjoyed even with few criticisms had fun and actually did catch all this time the long version new and interesting direction for pokemon having done the usual badges beat evil team for years although the catchphrase implied you had indeed catch them all was never the main goal you did you rarely got anything good unless you were shiny hunting and was really just for the sake doing make that the goal getting the true final ending this game was innovative and unique they took away the pressure the main path follow and instead put lot focus discovering all the pokemon the region also did good job making the wild pokemon feel more dangerous and not just pests now for the downsides didn encounter lot but the things did see are the most commonly talked about mainly the graphics not big whiner about but was definitely bit rough sometimes mostly when high when you the ground catching battling pokemon harder see however didn find that ruined experience playing there were also some encounters that were frustrating involving chasing really fast pokemon that dashed away soon you were their line sight well one battle particular was huge difficulty spike over any others and was really imbalanced favor the opponent kids are supposed able play this and gave rough time can imagine how much one might struggle against also multibattles exist but you still only get use one pokemon you can easily find yourself getting wombo combo death with nothing you can but watch basically definitely good game its core but could use some polish they this route again the future hope they listen criticism this one better balance the next one you weren sure about getting this one say this you committed pokemon fan you won want miss you just looking play the hot new game and really want pretty graphics you may want skip you just can accept how looks not perfect but good 
518,good game nice see the story behind the pokémon mythology famous characters and explication about some events other games but not perfect have bugs and the graphics sometimes not cool 
519,the most fun pokemon experience ever had always want the encounter change feels fresh and fun experimental and they get right yes this game need polish but definitely not lazy game you can easily tell that game freak put their love into the game but didn have enough time polish 
520,started playing today and far good this first pokemon game since red huge map with hundreds critters different behaviors fight capture this will keep satisfied for few hours for sure 
521,this the first time since 2006 that really enjoyed pokémon game course has its negative points the worst being the graphics and loading errors but apart from that the game does lot things right and new and pokémon keeps going like this the right track for the future 
522,you love pokemon but wanted fresh take the series this will make you happy and give you lot meat chew the music when there very nice opinion describe lot mystical dreamlike the battle themes however seem less varied compared past titles can recall more than different themes throughout the main storyline the main story more less typical pokemon filler meaning the bare minimum you would need call story and exists mostly get you from point some the characters have nice designs and there are ideas and concepts peppered throughout that caught interest but all all the story itself quite bland and lifeless unfortunate but not surprising the game does not always look great even good terms graphics you expected something that consistently beautiful and polished you let down the bulk reasoning for review score the gameplay which depending what you enjoy doing open world style games will either make break the game for you the alpha pokemon the new battle catching system and the exploration and gathering crafting all scratch itch for feels fluid fun and satisfying wander around doing these things tandem while the world itself the empty side and leaves much desired there enough out there keep wanting explore the pokedex research will put off some people who are more into the series for the competitive aspects there lot and required certain point for people like myself who like relax and wander without worrying too much about building top tier smogon team and plowing through the battle tower not going deter from enjoying the more laid back aspects the game arceus legends very important and positive step forward the series they choose keep going this way and learn from their mistakes they could very easily create not only the best pokemon game ever one day but one the best open world games ever one day they far from that point with legends but enjoyed immensely pokemon fan more than years 
523,simultaneously the best and most embarassing thing gamefreak has ever released fantastic game bundled very obviously underdeveloped package the pokémon models and animations look great but the world itself looks like early progress shot would see indie game dev share twitter laughable how bad the game looks some areas especially most caves and dark areas where the background will literally warp around your character like you poorly greenscreened have many other gripes such the story pacing lot dialogue scenes either need cut shorter more interesting voice acting would helped but otherwise the game honestly fantastic favourite pokémon experience date just wish came out like year later would have all the development time needed would love this style game continue and iterated major improvement over the old formula having game like this with more settlememts explore and more complex side quests etc would dream also thank god that they only released one version 
524,this was necessary experiment for the pokémon franchise and was executed fairly well most importantly think laid solid foundation for future sequels that will build the formula the game focuses entirely the single player experience which where differs the most from other games the series there battling other human players and minimal interaction with others and this entirely design the game serves prequel the pokémon franchise the areas you explore are very empty due them being underdeveloped this definitely gives the series long desired sense exploration and adventure not huge fan pokémon games played several them but skipped out others just wasn the mood that formula has not changed years this very welcome change pace while still keeping the core spirit the pokémon universe the gameplay loop feels much like early pokémon where the main objective just explore and catch all the pokémon pleasant game explore however the gameplay loop does get little repetitive found myself taking lot breaks but would regularly return has that breath the wild atmosphere which very relaxing minimal music the wild only ambient nature noises the music all very soft piano and vast open spaces also appreciate that they added some substance the story granted nothing crazy about but provides welcome change pace beat all the gym leaders and get their badges become the best that have been provided for the past years the graphics aren bad people make them out but they definitely aren impressive almost feel like they weren able high quality graphics whether cartoon realistic the game would have looked better with some degree artistic design maybe watercolor impressions anything really because the graphics damper the sense exploration little bit overall fun game can see myself taking time play through because just relaxing experience everything solid the effort exceptional but laid that groundwork for future sequels which can truly fantastic games can definitely tell you this far more exciting than any possible new generation pokémon they could introduce and probably one the most memorable pokémon experiences the last years 
525,had rock bottom expectations for this game until the leaks being honest here you ever plan playing buying this game not watch anything nintendo pokémon put out before the release date because the marketing did such terrible job selling this game but given game freak track record the last decade shocked they were able pull this off being pokémon fan the last decade has been rough oras was awesome sun moon were good too despite repeated playthroughs making sour them lot but everything else has been just short trainwreck gen was the definition lazy repetition aside from bringing everything was the laziest rerelease think all time the let games were yet another unnecessary remake the awful boring gen all know how bad sword shield were despite their dlcs doing slight bit justice bdsp finally showed lot fans how much passion for this series has been lost falling flat their faces trying remake their best games they more remaster than remake but let get into legends arceus fantastic game the breath fresh air that needed for years now might just have recent bias now but wouldn mind they didn make main series game for long time meant more games like legends negatives first the elephant the room since this game got revealed were the god awful graphics can say they definitely touched quite bit since then but still just looks plain bad like playing ps2 game 2022 yikes immersion breaking graphics your billion dollar franchise inexcusable when this console has given breath the wild mario odyssey learn how optimize your games already there reason that every previous switch pokémon game looks better than this one the pop bad too sometimes things just spawn right behind you front you you running around can get annoying when you want catch rare pokémon that been giving you the slip also the button layout really weird legends the point that almost hours still hitting the wrong buttons when trying open the map open the bag heal pokémon why dodge also made hands cramp lot after long play sessions please put out patch where can change the button layout the braviary flying feature needs work too why there accent button having take back off again again after slowly landing these huge open areas dumb think the biggest flaw aside from optimization the lack any voice acting was awkward more recent games but never awkward legends this game truly needed many the big story moments deserved more than text box with that annoying ass boom sound effect but there also much this game does right catching pokémon completing the pokédex has never felt better will never feel the same the slow mainline games ever again after this despite some pokémon being annoyances get least didn have shell out extra for 2nd identical version just for pokémon they didn put game lol the new boss battles are incredible too actually fighting pokémon foot swear had fever dreams about game like this when was kid feel like the only person who didn black out during the story returnal has conditioned reflexes dodge effortlessly guess the wide open areas are all distinct ton fun explore actually really loved the wild areas sword shield knowing this what they had their sleeve bravo just wishing they looked like 2022 game the story true pokémon fashion very lowkey until the end always but this time actually felt something was hurt was stunned the stakes the story established the whole time was filled with nostalgia feeling like kid again impeccable line walk there that deserves lot praise just talking thinking about fills with childlike joy that has been gone for long with pokémon even got fair bit challenge the new pretty good battle system who woulda thought course lot these positives have small quirks didn jive with 100 the time but legends arceus amazing foundation build sequels off that will hopefully perfect formula the end the day the damage previous games have done love trust game freak pokémon may never away but this game has done the impossible giving hope for the franchise again truly think this turning point for the franchise hope they full speed ahead never look back 
526,was very skeptical about legends arceus leading its launch was nervous that the new formula would innovative and unique but would ultimately leave lot desired was actually pleasantly surprised with what gamefreak delivered this the first pokemon game created style that vastly different from previous titles and maintained the pokemon feel while making sweeping changes the overall gameplay loop pros very fresh take the formula more action based gameplay sacrifices very little terms staple game mechanics good pokedex selection catching mechanic that stokes envy from the lets games varying and noticeable size differences the pokemon that makes each catch that much more unique serviceable plot much more streamlined competitive building pokemon that only requires pokemon fed certain items decent post game content being able summon all your pokemon once order chill interact with them interesting options for traversal new pokemon forms play with decent game economy encourages catching pokemon and collecting items and enraged pokemon are huge and fun capture cons not having multiplayer shame given how fun the single player content the levels are large but there not whole lot see them the appeal the open world wears off towards the end the game when all traversal mechanics are unlocked the graphics aren that great not enough trainer battles opinion the new pokemon forms are pretty ugly design wise decidueye except for few arcanine typhlosion and again opinion the boss pokemon catching minigame could have been much more fleshed out just wasn that interesting and felt bit tacked but feel step the right direction had loads fun playing arceus and was genuinely thankful that gamefreak not only shook the formula immensely but managed get many things right the first try none the cons listed above stopped from enjoying the game from start finish its far from perfect experience but experience that gets very excited for future legends titles 
527,the game not perfect but starting pokèmon game which tries more open man does its good work catching and exploring without limitation fun and reading about hisui hidden lore has been quite fun the problem comes when you try explore for longer times and the graphic holds you off little but manegable overall good but should really take more time games 
528,overall pla great game that brings lot innovation huge understatement and more lively atmosphere plus has good amount game time for someone play hours and complete everything plus overall well polished haven seen any reports major bugs glitches and the pokémon attacks look amazing however has lot downsides the newer pokémon designs the game should been thought out longer general say this someone who likes around all pokémon designs the visuals are bad obviously but personally don care about this would played ps5 game did the story well what you would expect from kid game nothing groundbreaking offensive biggest and arguably only real complaint that there isn that much gameplay variety you simply just battle and catch certain amount pokémon use moves certain amount times and the boss battle attacking this all rather cool but explained needs bit more order keep invested also the national dex small and the multi player nonexistent this sounds like lot complaining but just trying clear possible about the flaws should you buy honestly depends the person which know sounds like cop out but this the truth you want something that breaks free from the pokémon formula matter what yes buy you one those people that complain endlessly about breath the wild being empty don think about you one those people that are strict and will annoyed about things not being the game from before don think about you someone who loves playing around with pokémon and the surroundings yes you will love either way wouldn worry too much whether you made bad purchase not you still able have some fun 
529,good job game freak this game what pokémon deserves the new formula that works and delivers even with minor gameplay flaws and missed opportunities and with the graphics has good customization options nice plot really great gameplay loop haven been this invested pokémon game for the gameplay only since solid for 
530,this the best pokemon game since the n64 stadium titles and huge step forward for this franchise plenty room for improvement such better animations cleaner visuals and more gameplay mechanics with less grinding would make the sequel legends arceus contender for goty 
531,english pokémon legends arceus the best pokémon game since black and white not saying masterpiece but does lot what was asked for this game has the premise gotcha them all and succeeds you have search every corner cross sky and sea everything have them all being the pokémon game that always wanted from the beginning the game many moments gives you the feeling total freedom being able almost any corner that shown the map even complies with everything not perfect being often mediocre the controls are very good they respond perfectly and the vibration gives the touch but the pokemon braviary has rough control and very difficult control times the music quite good when exploring even had stop enjoy instant but the music the fights the same all the time almost all pokemon games are the same this regard but when the coach music also repeated without changing more than times ends tiring the story takes long time start but when does ends capturing you with the expectation knowing what coming but unfortunately ends very suddenly and the game never gives room for unknowns this much can share hope helps you when deciding whether buy the game español pokémon legends arceus mejor juego pokémon desde black white digo que sea una obra maestra pero hace mucho que pedía este juego tiene como premisa gotcha them all consigue hay que buscar todos los rincones cruzar cielo mar todo para tenerlos todos siendo juego pokémon que siempre quisimos desde principio juego muchos momentos sensación total libertad pudiendo casi cualquier rincón que muestra mapa aunque cumple con todo perfecto siendo muchas veces mediocre los controles son muy buenos responden perfección vibración toque pero pokemon braviary tiene control tosco muy difícil controlar ocasiones música bastante buena hora explorar incluso tuve que parar para disfrutarla instante pero música las peleas misma todo tiempo casi todos los juegos pokemon son iguales ese sentido pero cuando música del entrenador tambien repetido sin cambiar mas veces termina cansando historia tarda mucho comenzar pero cuando hace termina capturándote con expectativa saber que viene pero lamentablemente termina muy repentinamente juego nunca lugar incógnitas esto todo que puedo compartir espero que ayude hora decidir comprar juego 
532,the game awesome not perfect could better for sure mainly the grafics departement but after minutes tutorial and some dialogue boxes the gameplay really shinies had the same felling losing the notion time playing this game had when playing breath the wild and that good thing achieved 
533,this the best pokemon game ive ever experienced they have defiantly have taken some inspiration from breath the wild and have listened the fans sword and shield was joke after ten minuets that game hated but this totally different there isn enough hours the day play this grew with pokemon watched the series some the movies played blue gold crystal ruby and unfortunately shield those games had something new them each iteration gold had better progression system there isn huge jump power levels like there blue ruby probably the tightest pokemon game played for while but when shield came out was expecting what arceus offering here but got rehash what been getting for the last years this game looks like its early development its proof concept its poor and they need get some high level talent nintendo bring this the next level but the pokemon look good and the moves look even better leaves confused how doing some environmental textures could hard the lighting fine but its more texture issue the environment doesn really match the style the pokemon its odd and you dont really have sense where you are cause its all kinda samey unless your near waterfall beach something you can use some kind landmark this needs improvements but close getting that game always wanted for gameplay wise its pretty good have little issue with the gameplay its still turn based and you share exp but its harder still the pop and pop out ridiculous you could chasing down pokemon and then all sudden pop goes away this needs fixing the early its fine but not anymore the lack more the point the absence voice over jarring still stuck the with the text for speech pokemon one the biggest franchises the world they have enough for voice over budget giving this eight cause happy playing this has plenty issues that really should six but the nostalgia strong with this one 
534,love this game this what hope for sword and shield grafics are bad but its pokemon what mean they made over 200 pokemon whit new attack animation love the exploration could more details explore and filling pokedex think its the right way pokemon goes hope for other games like this one 
535,all know that pokemon has complete standstill for the past years but now that legends arceus has come out will admit that pleased with the expirence and disapointed the same time with hours under belt have say that this game good game iits not great but its not terrible but its just good highly reccomend not looking the reviews because its filled with people giving the game 10s but also giving the game reccomend just playing the game for yourself promise you will enjoy 
536,turn based rpg you can better the switch almost the entire look and lifted from breath the wild pokémon game completely blows the other games out the water the improvements the core gameplay are vast will extremely hard replay any the previous entries unfortunately for game freak this amount innovation setting high bar things like voice acting and dialogue trees are going must for sequels you can get away with copy pasting the entire game any more 
537,considering game freak track record recently this really fun bit janky game 
538,after almost hours gameplay can sincerely say enchanted this game and just can put down played continuously since bought free time just filled with after seeing what happened with had really low expectations was saying this going flop sure glad that didn happened not giving because feel there were alot things they could with the graphics goddammit just needs bit polishing maybe some more cool minigames different mysteries and wuests that you can randomly find the wild that would amazing feel this formula has amazing potențial become almost perfect rpg anyway glad this good and that bought maybe see dlc and even cooler pokemon games the future 
539,the new missions associated with every pokemón the freedom explore not just the open areas around you but doing with the intention find specific type pokémon distinguished not just his species but other specifications and not just that but how you catch that pokemón witch important and factor that contributes your research this very fun you have careful not just with the one you are aprouching but with the environment around you and the other creatures that are the art style the menus the one where you select the pokemón you witch the first choice your party always your disposal the new físicas pokedéx with all his missions pokemón already mentioned the overal layouts and the art choices are very good and create that feeling being the medieval era very good way the low points are the graphic questions and the lack other cities locations with more elements but doesn decreases the enchantment that this game 
540,almost hours and loving the battle mechanics are great and the fact that some wild pokémon are out for your blood soon they see you both hilarious and terrifying the only downside for the graphics the water especially overall breath fresh air for the franchise 
541,fun game didn blow mind but definitely laid the groundwork for future game that could doesn surpass the experience had playing the gen games kid but the shake ups the formula were for just enough for the series feel fun again for the first time over decade the game visuals seem the most common complaint but don really see gamefreak have never exactly been masters aesthetic quality and fine with that but looks passable sometimes even pleasant roaming around the village the first couple hours reminded bit the utawarerumono series the main zones did start become pretty drab after while but they didn make poor first impression terrain textures don matter they could have made them flat colors for all care the mesh lod pop much bigger problem the big things liked about the game the main gameplay loop fun going out way fill out the pokedex and earn new stars never got boring someone who likes jrpgs but tired encounters random otherwise this new approach pokemon battles feels nice starting and ending battles feels seamless and battle isn going way can quite literally just turn around and walk away love the effort level system while not without drawbacks makes the game more challenging the system from the mainline pokemon games rewards you just for sticking with pokemon long term effectively giving them massive stat modifiers this game main never felt invincible until went out way max out their els though does feel kinda gamey compared evs especially the process levelling them but just nice actually able see the numbers now each pokemon has inventory moves now and you can swap them and out the four use whenever you want like this lot better than the way works the mainline games there item that lets you evolve pokemon you would otherwise need trade evolve guy who never really cared for the trading thing appreciated this lot mounts are very cool but some more than others all big problems with this game most which are quality life related you can switch between zones without returning the hub area first and you can just return the village will either you have get back camp first and talk the scientist guy with his goofy hat first every single time and when you need somewhere the village for something you can just leave the second your business complete you have walk fast travel the gate first this started get really annoying after the first few hours would much better they let you jump between zones freely from the map the village slow get around that usually faster open the map and fast travel the building across the street than just walk there all the areas where you don have access mounts feel annoyingly spacious general the pokebox well this game equivalent quickly becomes eyesore you have talk specific npcs access and there meaningful option automatically sort filter for this game particular this big problem between the ability seamlessly throw pokeballs wandering pokemon without encounters the new pokedex research system and the new effort level system you are encouraged catch every pokemon you lay eyes but for actually sorting through all those pokemon you catch this game makes that process less laborious than would one the year old pokemon games that sucks lot there option skip most cutscenes the cinematic moments you free skip but the boring conversations you have times each throughout the game you have slowly click through each line uninteresting dialogue option shorten disable combat animations the main boss fights for each zone are pretty lame not because the bosses themselves are uncool but because the player role the fight chuck 100 bean bags them the mounts vary quality they more less this game answer the bicycle and traversal hms from previous games the deer pretty great the surf mount awesome and for sure highlight the game the rest though are just lame expected the flying one completely change how interacted with the zones been exploring that point because can fly right that should awesome like aircraft gta clone that you can pull out your pocket but just glider pretty much mean gliders aren bad but cmon man that was massive letdown after how cool the fish was 
542,are graphics good terms landscape they are about basic gets nowadays not necessarily bad just subpar and have seen the lowered framerate that the pokémon get have when you get certain distance from them terms actual gameplay itself though really enjoyed the core loop finding pokémon and doing different task order get more research point enjoyable you sort just get lost the exploring and finding pokémon only find yourself one the corners the area and you probably still missed few things the way despite the graphics this fun casual game play could easily see someone playing this long train ride car trip which the sort game you want portable system 
543,this finally very solid entry franchise that has been stagnating for the last half decade being very generous after swsh which was easily least favorite pkmn game all time and bdsp which was extremely pointless retread old game with very little the way anything new compelling offer was extremely skeptical and pretty convinced this game would end being mess but curiosity ended getting the better and really have say been pretty thoroughly won over here ultimately comes the gameplay actually being quite compelling this time around and all comes down the fact this game actually requires some thought the part the player not terribly difficult unforgiving anything but isn mindlessly easy either you might actually need think about type match ups what moves teach your pokemon there might even bit planning resource management and strategy play here pokemon game imagine that huh anyway have real massive complaints the game itself its quite fun and not the mindless check bunch things off list sort way even though there definitely some that here the only big shortcoming here the visuals have never cared much about graphics but unfortunately have say the game looks awful gamefreak needs more staff their visual department and that all there isn actively detrimental the game opinion but definitely going both some people more than others aware 
544,hours and look forward this game was quite disappointed first few hours the game minus the opening dialogue which gave goosebumps what saw was under baked game with pokémon sprites fluctuating quality depending where you were standing complete zelda botw rip off with less charm however once you get past the slow start inconsistent graphics the game starts pick your team gets stronger you able more less likely get destroyed the wild you can backtrack see what you missed previously once you get used the mechanics know how navigate around actually pretty fun there are plenty side quests actually bit annoying overwhelming because you see trillion people asking you things the village after the game bit want say there are some moments the game that are really beautiful the theme piano music starting you undetected the grass about throw pokeball kadabra lol also the combat pretty good quite visually appealing although bit derpy that you can run into the middle the battle anyways all things considered the game has definitely grown can actually bit addictiveanyways after quick review would say don take opinion for try yourself make your own mind 
545,obvious that the game not developed enough one would like but opinion very good start for new vision the franchise which can capture the pokemon more realistic world see the whole surface and also not need loading screens hope that from now the next installments seek use this formula but improve notably since obviously limps lot the graphics and the feeling living world 
546,visuals and graphic are really bad always for pokèmon game and right blame gamefreak for this the main storyline bit lame but doable once you get used the graphic style especially the first zone and the pokémon flying fps the distance you will start get captured the game and really enjoy the fresh innovations and the new type gameplay 
547,one the best pokémon since the beginning been long time since had fun capturing pokémon and seeing new one when exploring the map graphic wise they could have been better but since first open world for them was with hope the future they continue make game like this one and they upgrade the graphic 
548,been playing pokémon since platinum and been through quite bit burn out from the last couple games how does legends hold many will ask let get the big downside done first the lack art direction personally don mind lower graphics but this whole experience could been more stylized like mhst2 game picked recently play nino kuni which pretty old game came out the playstation and switch but holds because art direction second issue had mostly the abilities and held items the pokémon help differentiate pokémon from each other battle and because like few layers complexity specially turn based jrpgs now past the bad first can can say this the most fun ever had catching pokémon the game allows you engage them few different ways stealth the first option and the method choice getting the bonus from throwing the ball their back very satisfying you can take the pokémon head battle you want but most pokémon will run early game for those who run start the battle back throwing your pokémon them from behind fun the stun filling out the dex thought was gonna tedious but fun you gotta engage with few different aspects the the game you can catch them level your research level said pokémon give them berries find ones different weight size evolve defeat them battle with them see them perform moves also yes count you use them yourself battle and stealth catching them can also add the research levels also exploring the open zones finding pokémon great specially when you find rare encounter you didn see the first time going through the area pro tip heavy balls early game are your friend but you gotta get close but worth specially for catching alpha pokémon they give seed mastery you can use master move back town use heavy agile style with said move great exp for the team and good chunk money finally money which you need upgrading your inventory size onto the story and characters without any spoilers they are pretty good specially pokémon standards usual pokémon has very visually striking characters and they have great personalities too bad there voice acting which feels like the next step for pokémon with their game have tendency speed read without voice acting and then kinda forget little what said after the fact but that but overall think the story probably the best seen out pokémon black and white conclusion believe this game great with all the ways you can engage with catching and filling your pokédex the technical limitations show very heavily but the pokémon themselves are full life and personality with how they are animated hopefully the future these kind games are allowed more time bake oven with more solid art direction story and characters are great but still voice acting feels like would wonderfully series like this adding the charming characters overall this game they continue with this formula for older audiences that win 
549,huge step foreward for pokemon the semi open world huge improvement for pokemon but graphics could better and the lack trainer battles the one point critical the game even thought explained the story therefore only 10other positive improved fighting systems elite pokemon crafting need for trading with real people get pokemon like gengar pokedex system lot potential for upcoming gamesnegative graphics outdated for 2022 lack trainer battle 
550,the game not perfect far for mainly the graphics are the greatest point disappointment only they would have taken little longer polish out but alas can look over however since think the game the best and funniest pokémon game since the nintendo days also the first game long time that can truly play for hours end day after day hatching plan sneak strong pokémon you don really want fight but still catch and seeing that plan work out the best thing ever and even when you fail there still something learn from that failure apply the next time the and wild pokémon also feel stronger then other games which for huge plus makes you really think about what team you gonna bring when going into the wild tltr even though not perfect still very fun game and super refreshing for the pokémon franchise excited see what they next with this 
551,enjoy this game not much would were traditional pokemon game only gripe really the opening felt like took foreeeeeever actually start journey after having shovel through dialogue and cutscenes the tasks needed advance they just felt repetitive and the world felt bit empty entire time playing was imagining what would like battle gym wandering through kanto hoenn johto regions with this new engine hope they think about doing such that for the next canon game 
552,definitely imperfect and glitchy but lots fun like that the battles are bit more difficult this the direction they should have been taking for years 
553,overall good game like the new ideas like catching pokemon without having enter combat quickly switching between pokemon during battle also like the open world sections and enjoyed playing through the story unfortunately the game limited the hardware runs 
554,this the game all been waiting for day one pokémon fans back the days red and blue this what imagined the world pokémon like the open areas where you can joyously yeet pokeballs all the mons the overworld satisfying able have linear path with the story but still give you lot freedom terms how you want build your team and gain experience with all the research required complete the first pokédex true blend what fans have desired while think this game proves the strongest game the franchise gameplay wise will say the artistic direction could used lot more talent see botw switch launch title and look way more robust terms the environment than legends says that gamefreak dire need fresh eyes lead them into their next core titles well beefed switch enhance the overall experience with that being said the game still looking goty contender 
555,love this game made account just give rating just feels like heading the right direction many good changes that make the experience much better and new 
556,the game very good the story not bad there are moments the game that are very well done but there are others that are not for example there are many bugs 
557,first all didn finished the game yet but have idea how this game absolutely loving this game finally some good attack animations good plot with interesting charachters and lore but think that the best part the actual open world even the graphic could better the ambients are just fantastic love the pokedex mechanic and think that the real fun core the game however also found some strange things that made little confused already said the graphics are not that good but this not big deal for there are too many useless praises the main charachter that sometimes feel little bit cringe the game tends little bit repetitive some mechanics like finish boss then obtain new level then defeat another boss ect ect 
558,this game one the most important entries that the pokémon company has ever done thankfully this game delivers experience that many pokémon fans have been waiting for years however there are small flaws annoyances that keep from being the ultimate experience for pokémon man let start out with some flaws the game doesn look its best even for nintendo switch standards everything seems just lack polish detail but that doesn mean that the graphics are always bad just the point where starts get distracting and sticks out the fixed camera when first entering battle talking npc can either clip through completely obstructed object thankfully pokémon battles you can move around the battlefield one more thing that through the three noble pokémon battles that have completed which serve the boss battles the game they all feel like dodge and throw with real gameplay depth outside you can send out pokémon when the noble pokémon stunned but you can completely ignore this message and keep throwing balms and win without sending out single pokémon that the flaws might edit this review encounter more problems good things about the game now for the good things first this complete shift from the traditional pokémon formula there gym battles elite four any league become champion your job research pokémon and create the region first pokédex feel this gameplay can make break some peoples interest buy this game but encourage pokémon fans give this try for themselves see this the style gameplay they enjoy play the gameplay about catching and researching pokémon which the objectives can vary between defeating the pokémon with certain moves feeding berries seeing use moves just straight catching alpha pokémon can also appear around the map and will always tens levels above your party pokémon can also deal damage you the player causing you faint and lose some items you take too much damage love the animations the pokémon because they were able focus smaller pool pokémon and actually delivering that promise let not talk about swsh pokémon battles have also increased the freedom the player now after battle starts you are freely able move around the battlefield and look around with different viewing angles new mechanic added with agile and strong styles moves agile moves decrease the power the move and give your pokémon more likely chance getting their next move soon strong style the opposite increasing power and less likely chance getting the next move sooner this does give extra layer strategy and also scraps the idea alternating moves you can and will get two turns succession take two moves from opponent row side quests can lackluster but good thing when you don want progress the story speaking the story really can judge the story based opinions because style gameplay but when can say that there more dialogue and lot more cutscenes than regular pokémon game all all support the gameplay direction that gamefreak trying and hopefully this can regular occurring series and that some the ideas will implemented into gen and beyond big pokémon fan and hope that gamefreak will finally turn around the quality games that have been released these last few years 
559,some reviews for this game baffle decided post own because some the reviews here make the game seem better worse than claim things that are straight wrong and some them aren even reviews but just rants against the fans developers half them also give the feeling that the writer didn even play the game from the game actually shakes things when compared previous pokemon games the new gameplay formula actually fresh and interesting this game revolves mainly around building the first pokedex the location where the game takes place the hisui region previous games filling the pokedex was done simply catching pokemon and the whole page for this pokemon would filled immediatly that not the case here catching pokemon will only get you far this case despite what some others claim here fill out the rest pokemons dex entry you need interact with this pokemon variety ways catching and battling are obvious but there more seeing use certain moves evolving finding different forms genders feeding and all this will get you closer towards complete dex entry thankfully you don have every task fill entry when compared previous installments the total number pokemon this game lower than usual there are total 242 pokemon this game some may say this lazy game freaks end but personally think that this fine filling out the pokedex would nightmare there were lot pokemon which problem since that the main focus here also again despite what others may claim there are plenty new animations present for each pokemon having lower amount seems fair every pokemon also has their own personality the wild this pokedex and catching focused approach makes for fun gameplay cycle speaking the wild this game isn just your standard pokemon rpg there are big open maps for you explore each which are unique they are well designed exploration rewarded with collectibles items and pokemon but not mandatory catching pokemon handled differently here too you can the standard way battling them and weakening them but you also have the option catch them outside battle you may want take different approach depending the pokemon you after some are docile some are hostile and some are easily scared you can choose sneak pokemon using the environment around you lure them out with food you are being attacked you have dodge their attacks initiate battle throw objects them stun them the new types pokeballs complement this system well the battle system has also seen some changes specifically the new attacking styles and turn system the turn system was previously just done with the speed stat deciding who goes first but now the speed stat more important high speed can give your pokemon multiple turns back back but this also applies the opponent the new attacking styles also impact this strong style move makes you slower but more powerful while agile style move does the opposite both styles also take more than normal move you can also walk around during these battles but this doesn have much impact anything some battles will even have you outnumbered against multiple pokemon once due the setting story the game trainers aren very common but they are present gyms leaders aren here and have been replaced the noble pokemon these are essentially the bosses the game and have you battling them unlike any regular pokemon sure you seen this plenty times but graphically the game sub par the main issue seems muddy and low res textures bland lighting lack shadows and reflections and some performance related issues render distance objects and the framerate npc pokemon graphics don mean everything but this case all very noticable and should been better the game runs fine fps overall with few stutters here and there music sound design however some good stuff but this has always been stronger point for this series expert stories but what here fine pretty interesting mainly due the setting first two hours are pretty dialogue heavy due tutorials and whatnot and could been bit less quality life improvements are definitely present the best change here probably better gameplay flow thanks the better menu design and less menu general overal big step and fresh take pokemon new approach gameplay and fun cycle keeps invested with quality life improvements everywhere graphically sub par bur story and sound design are fine interested see where pokemon goes after this say worth full price 
560,regardless initial skepticism believe this really nice fun game wasn really sure would enjoy this entry since have always been more focused pokemon battles with gyms and the pokemon league rather than completing the pokedex this game solely related completing the first pokedex there aren many trainer battles which are made for introducing new challenges for example alpha pokemon think they nailed the gameplay loop quite well arceus introduces open world game where collecting and training pokemon lot fun and engaging haven enjoyed the latest main line games that much sword and shield diamon and pearl remake and arceus really feels like much needed breath fresh air for the series this not the best pokemon game ever made nor going satisfy everyone you are interested new take the pokemon series where you can freely explore world full pokemon engaging setting then this game could right your ally 
561,roughly hours and loving the game far obvious complaints are the graphics some pokemon don exactly interact with anything but that about story wise tad more mature than the older titles which always nice love the catching mechanics and the lack ton trainers every route incredibly refreshing all the characters are unique their own little ways move animations are beautiful and love the new battle system honestly everyone saying this the worst pokemon game ever need back years and play sword and shield 
562,solid game very addictive gameplay battles are streamlined compared sword and shield they take about 3rd the time complete this time there actually incentive catch them all graphics are huge letdown compared botw music good not good bdsp where the game shines the gameplay wish the world was more open like botw with less hand holding but compared other pokemon games that feel like they rails this breath fresh air 
563,finally some fresh air the pokemon franchise yes the game doesnt look good yes contains glitches but after all those years fan prayers were heard kind open world with roaming and living pokemon everywhere new way catch them and new methods complete your pokedex 
564,the graphics are just bad but that the only big point the gameplay feels great and think this really good step for the next pokemon games the best pokemon game played switch hope this the new gameplay for future pokemon games the rewarding system also fine and the side quest are okay with voice actors for the main questline and better graphics would still great experience 
565,this game has lot what wanted from pokémon game really good like the devs came together and said tired the complaints let make better pokémon game got lots good stuff cool story fine collection pokémon interesting characters some mysteries solve excellent music overdue quality life changes refined and addictive catching and battling mechanics interesting and sometimes beautiful world explore simply closer the pokémon game fans have wanted for decades the graphics are mostly and can look good and they certainly don take anything away from the experience they just rough and there pop and low res textures most importantly though lot fun the game clearly took some inspiration from zelda breath the wild but simply lacks things that botw got and those are things would need for rating anywhere close botw things like better textures voice acting more modern graphics larger more detailed areas more ruins and generally more explore more settlements and camps pokemon should doing more than just walking around aimlessly and sleeping dynamic weather affecting gameplay better quests and side quests etc the game still too much fun for imo 
566,the game play amazing finally redesign the original formula the boss battles are great fun only complaint the graphics are really weak lots alias artifacts and the pixels are very clear that more switch limitation would nice see port for similar style game 
567,hours and amazing the first hours were pain the ass and feel like they guide the player much infuriating prefer the game let you learn lot more yourself the mechanics aren complicated all there need explain everything like the first time playing video game life the combat system fluid and you can enter fight beat pokemon and then start doing something else right after the only compaint would that lacking bit you can summon more than one pokemon the time but you can fight against four there was way summon more pokemon the time the attacks could hit multiple targets would better something interesting the fact that you don have fight pokemon every seconds you prefer you can almost play the entier game just catching pokemons and gathering ressources really like have sequel with better graphics and polished mechanics that pretty much all needs rated 
568,start with the bad while the gameplay has evolved the methods story delivery have not changed bit since the days the lots reading and one big climactic fully rendered cut scene this fully expansive world the story still dull cutscenes with text box after text box and voice acting while this isn inherently bad nothing interesting provided keep your attention the animation and rigging downright lazy times and the human character expressions movement are uncanny despite their brilliant designs every time you interact with human shatters the immersion they play back the same basic movements the story itself decent but hidden behind layers telling instead showing black screens and sounds imply something happening find myself just pressing the button rapid succession get back the actual fun parts the graphics are the next gripe genuinely looks like wii game older and doesn seem that gamefreak developers had the time truly optimize this game for the system girlfriend who doesn play video games all commented that looks like old game the first time she saw play optimizing takes time seems they just dialed down the graphics focus other more important things while the game looks great sometimes and the models are beautifully designed the graphics cannot overlooked ugly textures objects randomly clipping through each other character details like hair are flat and lifeless hovering inches above the ground some areas you get now here where the game get literally everything else right first pokémon game was pokémon diamond and this the most fun had playing pokémon game since then the core gameplay downright addicting the act sneaking pokémon learning their behavior stunning them with items choosing when battle just chefs kiss really feels like you the world pokémon running around just catching the little guys like you always wanted kid the wild battles are high stakes lot the time only takes one alpha pokémon knock out your whole team found myself feeling genuine terror the first time saw that alpha rapidash something that more than welcome pokémon game this regard everything you could want until that pesky story gets the way easy spend hours upon hours just filling out research tasks huge jump the right direction for pokémon the old battle mechanics ran their course over decade ago also exceedingly clear that this game gamefreak love letter sinnoh from the music placement landmarks and overall design the wild areas really fun feel like you exploring the past version the region you explored kid the moment you realize you eterna forest one the legendary lakes with the music boot second none you won enjoy this game nearly much you don have the nostalgic ties sinnoh overall while this game definitely drops the ball lot areas picks and runs with many others had hours upon hours genuinely bewildering experiences playing this game just running around and catching pokémon the way the lor arceus intended the gameplay second none and shame that gamefreak didn get the proper time see this game all the way through 
569,one the best pokémon games ever played course has its flaws like graphics pop and empty places but was still very enjoyable and appreciate that the pokémon company took risk and can say was worth 
570,great new direction for the franchise fantastic world building and lore expansion and fresh battle mechanics all make the best pokemon game over decade let down the graphics and somewhat grindy aspects 
571,this game preview what future pokemon games should look like the gameplay great and with the pokedex quest quite entertaining but lacking some basics for example breeding abilitys special evolution mega zstones dinamax though liked some graphic elements grassstalks attacks the overall graphics are garbage the diffuculty was unexpected high was continuously underleveld and had trouble travel areas without resting the trainer battles were easy not level dependent but with abilitys items this could improve the difficulty really hope they continue evolving the series this direction and maybe even doing this bigger scope and with better graphics 
572,not prefect there some graphical issues and lack voice actingbut all around refreshing change for gameplay gamefreak made good pokémon game since gen 
573,the game great and game freak really did good job trying out new things the only thing that miserable are the graphics 
574,lot great points about the game not the usual beat all the gyms then move the elite and become the championstory makes sense and the new features are great like being able fly working with pokemons the game also harder than the previous game pokemon sword and shield which also good thingthe jubilife village theme changes the more you into the storynot forget that your character and the wyndeer gets dirty depending how much did you travelto the cons nowgraphics could much better and looks like game from the 2000s doesnt mean the game bad the price the games are questionable but nothing can done with thatpeople who say the game bad without playing are ignorant 
575,100gameplay barebone everything this game but already satisfying going around and throwing pokéballs 
576,this the most untertaning pokémon game played for years yes graphics are kinda ugly and there are some visual glitches from time time but that really anecdotic when playing game the soundtrack sweet mix nostalgia and modernity and the sound design awesome the gameplay innovative and can get little spicy especially postgamei would recommend this game more than any other pokémon game 
577,have not played the entirety this game but far really enjoyed this new pokémon game sure the graphics could little better but with the open world experience and that you can catch pokemon without having engage into battle really awesome 
578,summary classic game pokèmon would have preferred open world than open map and graphics maybe better here are the level unity crap however the leveling system strange throughout the story you can also equal level but towards the end you are required have team leveled well this call unbalancing and not good all sincerely hope that for other games the series they improve starting from their negative points but knowing gamefreak 
579,the most fun pokémon game played years the new gameplay mix stealth and combat very polished progression game lock behind what your star rank given you motivation catch and pokedex research the game pokedex research simple and easy come done how many pokémon you catch how many you have beaten battle what type moves you beat pokémon the biggest complaint have the game engine they used think the same one game freak used for sword and sheild with textures pop slow and the pop before pokémon which can get annoying texture with glitch out battles and wild pokémon will randomly clip thought rock and tress making them uncatchable and graphic aren good all but its game freak they never work that 
580,great step forward for the pokemon series however needs work honestly the most fun ive had catching pokemon and running through the world this game has revamped the combat system well the pokedex would recommend this anyone who has played pokemon and people who have been wanting something more from the franchise the reason gave this game even though the world fun run around and the combat interesting the game does look pretty bland mostly due graphics this surely great step forward for the franchise but there lot room improve 
581,this game promising evolution for the pokemon series and hope the direction the series will was absolutely addicted the gameplay loop navigating the open area and doing the different requirements needed for each pokedex entry highly recommend this game any pokemon fan 
582,god the world envrionment ugly gameplay really good though would say that you are able look pass the story lack multiplayer battle system gym battles and the horrendously bland and lifeless world hisui this alright game pick but with company big game freak feels kinda lazy and they should doing more 
583,completed 20hours was extremely boring story gyms leagues easily exploited gameplay that allowed catch everything with single ball and aggro graphic old looks like ps2 era idea why people rate this higher than sword and sheild when half baked game add ability throw ball which pokemon nothing new 
584,legends arceus just game without its franchise would definitely mediocre collect thon with some qol elements serviceable plot subpar graphics and musical score which while charming bit too subtle the overworld the fact that has full game price tag would definitely turn some people away with that said pokémon game pretty damn good not great but good the game new focus old catch all motto has turned out for the better why the best way describe why address how this game deals with the complaints previous entries have received same old gyms and championship and your exploration the world and your capturing pokémon now serve the goal posts for your progress trade evolutions gone with game item animations while the models and art style the world are worse they are more expressive than remember them being both bdsp and swsh too many cutscenes dialogue boxes plot the point catch all and quests advance you will not kept from the game for too long any point level capture block gone not worry though catching strong pokémon not going suddenly break the game for you the one thing that still restricted are the level limits your pokémon obeying you catch one out your league and will not listen you too much experience while you still have exp share distributed better and more sparingly can catch level rapidash the starting area due fluke and only get few levels say pretty balanced grinding sucks the focus catching and that where most your exp going come from just sneak and throw long battles necessary except certain cases you can battle but battles suck this game gave one hell boost your opponents they can abuse the special mechanics you can use and the strength level differences not pronounced now you have play smart since the combat isn just single turn switches anymore listen you wanted pokémon game that would erase all the past controversial entries this not that game very fun but many people rightfully think this could have been done sooner and better still can help but really enjoy this game maybe just one time thing but sincerely hope that the fun having now sign that gamefreak going the right direction with its game development 
585,this game step the right direction open world change style and gameplay was sorely needed after years the graphics are not top notch but man the gameplay fun they took risk although not far enough but the best pokémon game years now they need push further make truly open world create better for roaming pokémon interactions with environment better animations add gyms back the next one allow ride your own pokémon ground air and sea add more towns and cities explore more caves and dungeons add more raids and add multiplayer aspect maybe something akin destiny where players share the open world with you any given time again step the right direction can wait for the dlc and future releases with this formula excited for the future 
586,this solid gameheres reasons bulletpoints and then short explanationfirst positive step forward for the franchise overworld maps are bigger then expected pokeball choises are amazing bunch the bossfights are great only few trainer battles and most them are decent you never feel burned out them you barely get annoyed the rival alot good character designs customization decent riding feels great and fluid going through maps good oppertunities catch rare mons are there and they are good you can catch every mon the game including special evolutions trade evolutions have item now and thats amazing few rly good siequests some which can permanently alter things and thats amazing sometimes the game looks good new fighting system interesting some sideobjectives that are kinda neat legendary battles are nicenegatives the game kinda flat content maps feel empty with nothing them overworld filled with overly agressiv pokemon who will get aggrod from insanely far away forway too long maps can feel like hotrooms where everybody wants kill you and that rly fast some sidequests are downright the wisp thing interesting but kinda dumb too radar would have been good for this minimap and that would have been needed alot riding camera unacceptable its horribly bad wild pokemon are insanely unbalanced lvl maxed out mon can get murdered turnsby lvl mon that just cant thing wild mons can alot times attack you twice before you can even single thing pokeballs can bounce off the air sometimes its simply not possible gaige ball can hit sometimes you cant catch mon because the catch range not enough and thats rlyinconsistent somehow the story kinda wack and dont know wth going the grand scheme things whatis even happening the game often ugly flat and just bad boring design wisethis encompassesstyle its poor mans breath the wildpresentation its poor mans breath the wildvisuals washy colours look flatstability this game not rly lagging but anything further away then you can throw apokeball will look like lagging out loading half pokemon just stand around only hand full them are actually doing something ponyta forexample will try play with you but rly most them want you dead and there isnt rlyanything between most the time desperatly needed some defensiv mons that wouldbalance out helping you fear away mons progression kinda meh there was definietly better option here for example pokemon half the lvl the mons that will obey you should not attack you anymore you command mons lvl mons under arent agressiv towards you give clothes properties like better stealth something like that its rly lazy yeah total alot missed chances but still was totaly playable game and while alot times being good the game managed piss off bad when cam while riding non stop got stuck when pokemon would permanently break stealth out nowhere when pokeballs didnt work because was far away which sucks alot times when wild mon lvls under own mon oneshots mon and then get options for battle even engage them like wtf bro mediocre sword and shield less the mediocre bdsm remakes would improvement over the last game without anything big when game improves but its not fully realized also washy and inprecise controls earn anything aobe this the ideas are realized and also bit deeper works fine the game outright amazing and for the time has been released date which this game 100 not looks like crap runs almost bad and features seem rushed the game actually pushes forward what means game that genre works fine and its time beyond what others deliver this not the case here the game 100 underdelivers and prol needed another years pure development this good whats could have been done years more development cleaning the game adding more things the overworlds coop for the maps like they did bdsm underground wild area increase stability polish visuals adding few more behaviors for the very limited pokedex all this could possible easy and would make the game other games manage accomplish this and pokemon billion dollar franchise excuse the world can excuse this not being the case this thing sells millions copies 
587,good but lacking some heavy graphicals features that game from past 2010 have for the price not excuse the switch isn powerfull enough anymore are 2022 not 2008 
588,nearly hours when writing this review first impression for this game that probably the most unique pokemon game far the fact that gamefreak decided try something new pokemon game without reusing the previous pokemon formula really impressed overall the game wasn really mind blowing but did laid the groundwork for future pokemon games there are some other stuff work such the visual and graphic voice acting pokemon always somthing wanted the game and kinda disappointing that they continue overlook that aspect although love the new game mechanics catching pokemon that was implemented felt that the map this game really empty and lifeless times the missions the game could tedious time when they force you catch pokemon amount progress all things consider good pokemon game that could have been better and hope that gamefreak will continue improve their future pokemon games they are going down the right path with pokemon legends arceus 
589,this game had the potential masterpiece unfortunately the lack voice acting and polished improved graphics prevent that being said this still good game and worth the adventure for pokemon fans has excited for the future what pikemon games have store truly hope they will give one pokemon game the time and love deserves make game good super mario odyssey and breath the wild this the closest have gotten but there still long way 
590,good feels fresh new catching system great just feels kinda rushed thou and like wants you mainly catching the same pokémon all the time fill out that pokédex and there even less emphasis placed story and battles don like how there almost trainers battles having high level good pokémon being pointless 
591,the new style gameplay fresh and exciting however feel disappointed the lack pvp pokemon abilities and held items the open world aspect fun and questing feels more like modern rpg than pokemon while the graphics npcs and the game general are laughable the gameplay smooth when throwing pokeballs and using mount transverse the open world 
592,you may want stick this review out rollercoaster ride there are two driving forces this game one force that takes the game either direction the direction being good game there the amount fan service the game new forms pokémon regional origin story new strategies collect pokémon breath the wild menus sounds and gameplay the negative driving force however how long takes for the player able enjoy these things isn the player always learning new things that they must use the gameplay the opposite actually almost everything needed complete the game handed you right off the bat this not inherently bad feature this kind freedom allows each player create individual experiences and choose their own way complete each task sadly this game there are choices made simply game where you build your collection with new environments only serving change scenery even then the same forest area used for majority three out five areas finally the graphics are unacceptable this something that can looked over when talk about quality since gameplay most important but sad thought when you realize every once while how poor the graphics are with all the complaints somehow someway this game made return desk and continue where left off the night before why was coming back what kind game turn and start complaining about freedom for once you aren just pokémon trainer you collector researcher the one that others look you are the obstacle their way from the very start for pokémon fans this story one they wanted know for long and want even more the future pokémon history being played out and created you the most important thing the entire game collecting and studying things about pokémon that have never been such large focus effort that what this game has not the norm for the developers unexplored territory they made their mistakes the game has flaws but has the soul that good pokémon game should have they didn leave out crucial features make the game more marketable wider audiences they didn make the story simple everybody could follow huge chapter the pokémon world and one that worth experiencing even through the flaws core fans all have our opinions about this game but this game will absolutely built the future and foundation for the future fun the pokémon franchise 
593,good improvement the pokemon formula the gameplay loop awesome you completionist like the things that are being the score down this game either unoptimized the switch the switch not powerful enough for the game think mixture both are true there lot pop and have seen other games that shouldn able run the switch able run quite well this disappointing the other thing the small dex size 240 pokemon for franchise that right around 100 too small reasonably charge bucks 
594,first sight pokemon legends arceus seems the game fans have been pleading about for all these years open world game where you can freely explore the lands and fight pokemon way that true but the execution was very flawed the game restricted zones otherwise known open zone game this was disappointment especially when the earlier trailers made out game similar botw not only that but the game restricts you from entering certain areas zones you haven filled out enough the pokedex however this shouldn too much issue long you are doing more than just following the missions the main gameplay loop very fun being able explore freely the zones course and catch fight run away from pokemon doesn get old well least for most the game starts tedious after while especially because required access certain areas the pokemon don anything interesting they are completely lifeless they either walk around sleep occasionally teleport depending the pokemon why not have some pokemon fight with each other occasionally have two pikachu touching their tails greeting which quite literally their pokedex entry stuff like that which would make the world feel more active the zones themselves are bare boned with only the most basic terrain not mention the graphics are awful for 2022 nintendo switch game the terrain looks worse than games the gamecube when you aren following the main story exploring the world for fun you probably doing requests otherwise known sidequests these sidequests are the most basic boring and tedious tasks you can think they all the same catch specific pokemon fill out specific pokemon pokedex entry collect certain amount item bring back the requester felt like doing homework going through these however there are couple fun ones one them you get catch shiny ponyta but like said there are only couple these feels like the developers were asked make sidequest system last minute they had rush like 100 them and made them all practically the same thing there story but pretty awful every cutscene just two more characters staring eachother with sound effects voice acting and these cutscenes happen all the ing time the tutorial the game like hour long and you are constantly being interrupted whenever you get chance actually something these interruptions are not frequent the tutorial throughout the rest the game but that isn saying much pokemon legends arceus has great concept but incredibly obvious game freak half assed many things not truly open world and the restrictions placed upon you really take away lot the fun you could have however despite all this the gameplay loop still incredibly addicting and fun the point where this game deserves hope get more games like this the future which all the issues are ironed out because this game really had potential 
595,the game very fun and addictive but the graphics are terrible and the gameplay feels like pokemon with open area elements like monster hunter surely enjoyable game you pokemon fan but deserve better and game freak needs take their time and make fantastic game that can forever remembered not just rush game development and put low effort they can make money from games every year 
596,pkmn legends arceus pla step the right direction but still shows how gamefreak makes minuscule progress game design let start out with the good haven had fun playing pkmn game many years and finally game delivers the fun haven felt pkmn game had hope considered good game until now that being said baffled why made this game worse than needed fans have been complaining how long tutorials are and this game tutorial pain play and yet for all the new features the game the tutorial teaches you none them really its essentially just capture pkmn tutorial that sort the story this game fun play but the game refuses let you enjoy there are many cutscenes this game that take you out the experience why you still can skip them beyond why still have wait for each text scroll before can continue the next one makes sense honestly this game had skippable tutorial and skippable cutscenes just none all would much more pleasant experience the sad part about that complaint that has excuse yes the graphics are awful but there million excuses can give for that engine switch can handle time constraints risk project success etc but the tutorials and cutscene pacing was conscious choice that could been avoided glad this game exists and hoping can merge all these changes into new mainline series games right now pla step the right direction for but unfortunately super safe dive change and continued display antiquated game design would love for continue along this path and not give but this game not quite there giant leap for pkmn game but tired giving pkmn pass just love the franchise much 
597,like the exploration mechanic but sometimes the game feels too repetitive the missions would more epic keep farming and exploring all the time the alpha battles breaks this little but miss the epic battles gyms 
598,definitely weird pokemon game the bad the graphics are bad and they only get worsethe story not very good and the lack voice acting considering the graphics doesn the game any favoursthe game wants you complete the pokedex but couple really long term collectathon puzzles that artificially pad out timemost the best parts the game are locked after the credits even hours the story gated pokedex progressionthe good exploring areas and finding new pokemon funthe game has made filling the pokedex significantly more active taskthe new battle system better and creates closer and more strategic battlesthe final act the story enjoyablethe soundtrack has some genuine bangerspokemon legends arceus asks you complete the pokedex fully unlock the whole game able then turn around and appreciate the value what you played but big here how many people are really going that least players are not going reach the very end and are result going leave this game having experienced mediocre story with enjoyable final act some players will reach the end the post game story quest which genuinely has awesome conclusion and honestly challenging but very few are going reach the very end this game rich with little optimisations the pokemon formula the rocks and trees that you throw your pokemon gather resources for crafting are great system the ride pokemon that allow you travel faster over water and through the air mountains great system the addition strong and agile style and the move order really make long battles way way better once you get grasp how work the system excellent the cheeky moves you can and your opponents will also make battles significantly more even fights than ever before unfortunate that very few trainers the game have large parties pokemon that allow the system shine crafting great for the most part wild pokemon behaviour great the pokedex challenges that change from pokemon pokemon keep the game fresh the boss fights are good idea that has lot potential but some them didn land this time around this game brought down much its graphics and gamefreak pulled punches the game simply ugly the ugliness this game never relents and all times making the experience worse than could textures are constantly being reused pokemon load distance can fine but can also abysmal with pokemon loading only you few metres away you flying over feels like gamefreak hasn tried and that this game more pitch the playerbase asking how does this new gameplay loop feel this game has landed well because always enjoyed the catching pursuit the game want see where this game takes gamefreak has done some excellent things with this game and from here matter trimming the fat like the artificial time sinks the story progression gates and refining what else has potential here battles largely unsung and that shame pokemon feel more alive than ever their environments boss fights are pretty cool the story was one the best pokemon stories and really wasn good for the most part improve and add more these parts the game that have potential and eventually have great game 
599,love this game think one the best not the absolute best pokémon games that has ever been made also think will contender for goty which will true achievement for this game and the series scoring have because they seemed stop working the game point and just accepted where was the narrative this game has story which loosely makes sense interesting captures the imagination everyone from the newest trainer the most hardened veteran but there are parts where just doesn seem far enough each boss fight feels repetitive with real mechanical changes present them other than the monster you are fighting there are parts the game where the narrative does genuinely tug the heartstrings and make the player feel that real world with people that should care about but also after the initial scene you waking beach completely different time era there basically mention trying get home understand that the point the game fact catch pokémon but even some point during the collection the research something was mentioned along the more learn the closer are figuring out how might able get you home would more dynamic all feels little lazy and like they couldn find way start the story they just through you coming back time gameplay really the gameplay incredible for pokémon game don feel like just making these incredible creatures fight for reason instead can just catch pokémon the guise research and then release them regular part the game truly amazing step for the series every throw pokeball feels great and each time craft something masse get little shot serotonin knowing that made own pokeballs however for some reason that never explained narratively visually appear completely unable climb even the simplest hill nor can swim for some reason the reason for these hinderances player are obvious they don want access the areas early when the pokémon are stronger but least make visually narratively interesting can make that hill because too steep and you don have climbing gear maybe raining simply slippery climb you can swim because pokémon will attack you maybe because you character don know how swim least give reason for these road blocks game which proudly calls itself open world final thoughts this game tremendous step forward for pokemon series adds new breath into something which hasn truly experienced new ness what feels like over two decades hope that they take this side series new area the future well whether that means ancient hoenn region perhaps ancient alola anywhere but kanto also hope that whatever the next main series game borrows from least the innovation the gameplay that pokémon are seen less competitive tools and more like the subjects research that the game proports them 
600,pokemon legends arceus bold new step nintendo and gamefreak that would have been outstanding several years ago pla does great job making you feel like you truly exist the pokemon world and does good job immersing the player through all the new mechanics presents catching new pokemon more dynamic than has ever been before you can choose the old route start battle weaken the enemy then attempt catch them you can utilize the open world and items you have your disposal distract feed even stun them and simply throw the ball even possible use this method catch alpha pokemon unaware and capture them without need battle there all new crafting system well while quite simplistic does get the job done found myself going out into the wild simply gather materials for crafting action reward basic good job the game also goes solid job offering newer more powerful items you progress make seem like you actually improving member the survey corps story wise what you expect from pokemon game solid enough keeps your attention for the most part but nothing remarkable there wow moment the story nor are there any moments that elicit much emotional response towards the end was skipping dialogue because just wanted play the game the battles themselves are largely the same the ability run around was interesting for the first couple battles but after that forgot you even could and stopped doing altogether there real reason move around outside seeing different angles pokemon don randomly target the player character battle and long you don stand directly between the pokemon fighting you safe from harm some status conditions did get updated which felt long overdue now the bad the game looks terrible the game runs terribly unacceptably awful for full fledged console game 2022 jagged edges frame pacing models popping and out existence and several graphical glitches plague the game and severely hurt the score either time for gamefreak find new game engine for nintendo find new developer this does not cut clear like the art style they tried for could have been very aesthetically pleasing appearance but just isn ugly and very poorly optimized the retail price does not reflect the amount polish put into this game very disappointing presentation for pokemon the switch again all all greatly enjoyed experience and will likely playthrough the game several times know this world hyperbole and dramatics seems like low score not this was fantastic step the right direction ball their court improve upon 
601,this game definitely fresh take repetitive formula the main focus the game collecting pokemon and does that better than pretty much any other game the series however also times feels like you are play testing upcoming title for one the graphics look like something from years ago furthermore the main plot could improved voice acting however many vital features like breeding online battles are just completely missing 
602,huge step into being the pokemon game dreamt for years but really could used another year dev time add more and polish more than any other pokemon game you can feel the pokemon company crushingly strict yearly release schedule this game stifle this game potential but all fun pokemon ever was ignoring that 
603,good yes there are some major flaws with this game but definitely step the right direction for pokémon 
604,extremely fun and enjoyable game this game pokemon game that have been waiting for made takes elements other open world games and adds into the pokemon universe the combat extremely slick and seems almost fresh but old some gamers the one thing wish was built upon more was the visuals although pokemon legends arceus very fun and entertaining game lacks the visual department but that doesn mean good game overall 
605,new pokémon game you not buying this game because the graphics but because you can fill the first ever pokédex and find various types pokémon 
606,pokemon has generally been going the right direction let and sword shield brought the aspect that game freak denied avid players for years the system pokemon legends arceus terms battle and capture unquestionably superior every pokemon game preceding the death the battle screen satisfying say for the least the world interaction great addition issue the better looking battles are few and far between there are not many pokemon trainers this game nor are there gyms the storyline had induced the building towns settlements upon completion that led more trainers and the first ever gyms the game would have been 1000 more effective while this game certainly succeeded putting old and tired mechanics rest failed foregoing the aspect competition hope that arceus will remedy this way dlc and hopefully much more expansive dlc than those saw sword shield all all this certainly better direction for the catching battle and exploration aspect the franchise 
607,besides the hirribal graphics and some physics the game great gameplay wise side quest are bit repetetive 
608,tldr flawed but good pokemon experience its core this game something but gamefreaks execution pretty disappointing still enjoy playing emerald and really don need perfect graphics but think the graphics this game are pretty laughable only out done but the overall world design feels empty the textures are all the same but exploring the world fun and catching the pokemon also fun hopefully let someone else take over making these games the future but you like pokemon you like this game 
609,fun game but the entire battling aspect the games essentially put the back burner and forgotten not nearly enough opportunity use the team you assemble love the new mechanics and open world aspect but the graphics are rather poor 
610,the best beta have ever played this the best way summarize this game the world lacks depth and feels empty graphics could easily improved the difficulty too low even for pokemon game there are real pokemon fights until end game there should option chose which difficult mode you want play longer years old and longer want play versus trainer that only has pokemons after playing hours game also too much pointless dialogues 
611,while this the shakeup that the pokemon franchise desperately needed ultimately flawed its execution the game play great the story not much found myself just getting through the story without caring much about anything anyone catching pokemon different and unique ways fantastic strong and agile style feel like they need more time the oven performance unacceptable for game that looks this poor the game feels needed more time reach excellence happy that everyone enjoying their time the game though however feel disingenuous give this game with glaring issues such these 
612,the standards for pokemon games all time low while legends arceus means bad continues the trend barebones game that feels immediately outdated franchise that just doesn seem grow backwards step maybe reduction the formula set new foundation for later games but just bit too late for the world isn enjoyment traverse hindered being visually underwhelming but just lacks sense activity the pokemon exist only for the player they don interact with the world any meaningful way they just collectibles the past this wasn big problem because creating team conquer the league was always your goal here the pokemon are the only real goal yet they just linger mostly aggressive timid creatures not really displaying much their nature showing character maybe you now thinking expect too much and yes expect lot from one the most successful franchises lifetime considering other titles the franchise have had features that would suitable here but the trend with pokemon games lose features and gain and yet here are with one the most well received games the franchise while only seems because the game just about good enough step the right direction absolutely good pokemon game sure vacuum just pokemon games may one the best but the opinion should better call entitled but having supported the franchise since the first iteration think the fanbase deserves game much higher quality which now leaves the position all want support the good parts the franchise hopes get better versions that but the excitement and initial highly positive reaction from just getting something that isn disappointment means the quality this game which quite low more than enough for company that just wants make more money okay game not bad but not great and when the honeymoon period wears off back state disappointment wait for something truly good 
613,completed the 100 the game last night always recommend this game the franchise fans but not without many criticisms this game changes the game play completely with many long awaited new mechanics that can only hope will stay the future games still major improvement from the past games especially the recent bdsp remakes unfortunately the technical aspects this title are lacking and may lower the enjoyment this experience lot sad know that your avatar exploring forest just because its name appearing the top corner and not the visual environment unsatisfying having many places very similar one another inside the same map the art direction great always but the immersion ruined its lacking knew this lacking the trailer but would have still granted out this game not for another very disturbing aspect the writing this game new low pokémon had always had childish writing but this instance every other dialog contradicts the one before are time where pokémon are feared but the village population from well established region where they already have pokéride and are living peacefully with the pokémon are told that one knows how capture pokémon then they explain how they told are the greater battler but have teacher for that way more skilled than are told that all the pokémon are fearsome then are shown other character knowing that there are many species that are very peaceful toward them and easy catch live with know this game mostly for children but would love have game not contradicting itself often the combat mechanics are improvement but they need some fixing especially while battling other trainers you build like slow team might occur that when one member the next one entering will have wait moves from the opponent resulting another without being able anything late game had rethink team because one trainer attacked times row demolishing team this not rise the difficulty but some design flaw since might want play with favorite pokémon without having such disadvantage and all slower pokémon fill penalized over all the game good one and the game play loop enjoyable they keep working their optimizations skills and fix the few problem this game could new starting point for the brand 
614,really enjoy playing this game and cool because this what all pokemon players ever wanted but why one have voice this game needs more anti aliasing when playing docked3 need more character animations for some choices game like pressing stone button instead chat selections need better way track side quests and track pokemon progressionsometimes feel the dev team had some lazy decisions about some aspects the game but the end good refresh for the pokemon game franchise and expect more the next games like online coop battle arenas and more 
615,finally the franchise out its old classic gamestyle compared with other jrpg nothing looks increadible but pokemon charm very strong from technical point view pla looks like 2002 game with worst art direction 
616,played about hours legends arceus good game there lot that could been done better absolutely are there some things they should expanded upon yes step the right direction though certainly the gameplay arguably the most important aspect game and happy say that what legends arceus provided strangely satisfying when looking trailers you may concerned that the environments have nothing really explore this somewhat true the terrain can bit dull times but there are also times where you find yourself wandering into this hidden corner the map and you rewarded various things even when the terrain isn too interesting you find that the pokemon and items you pick will make for when comes the requests can bit mixed some will really interesting slightly comedic almost pokemon anime fashion wield some cool rewards others however will just leave you looking how complete your phone due just being boring scavenger hunt don mind having look for stuff but think some hints that would narrow down where search would made the experience lot better the battles with noble pokemon can surprisingly difficult and has very consistent difficulty curve the only one have issues with the cobalt coastlands and that mostly because the arena makes feel like you fluffing your way through until you finally manage somehow beat was still fun but could been better the one the alabaster icelands has favorite hard but fun type hard the trainer battles are for lack better description interesting the beginning the story very basic and comparable sword and shield battling the time you get the post game though leans more towards the almost unfair territory you expect from cynthia platinum and arguably beyond that the battling itself has changed lot this game and feelings are bit mixed one side adds bit strategy that was appreciated the other side can seem bit unfair and annoying especially when some pokemon out speed you right out the gate the new status effects are actually pretty cool and wouldn mind they were implemented into generation the crafting also nice touch and surprisingly well balanced overall give gameplay the story fairly average until you get the post game lot feels like could gone deeper been explained with less presses the button think two things that game freak should learn the future show rather than tell and not repeat single point several times better than was sword and shield but still needs some work the last plot point the post game was definitely worth though the story for not expect the best legend arceus graphics and animation some terrain from far away can look downright ugly and not properly portray what actually out there for instance you look the heartwood from the heights base camp almost all the trees are nonexistent the anti aliasing can also really weird times especially around water the animations department actually bit better comparison isn quite monster hunter levels but most the animations are good enough keep you immersed there are times mostly while doing requests where somewhat obvious that they took some shortcuts but nowhere near bad sword and shield for graphics and animations the music one legends arceus high points blissful when you into the heartwood traverse the lands night because the music just brings you sometimes you don want battle pokemon just you can hear some these tracks without interruption there are two tracks that play the cobalt coastlands that takes out the mood though cobalt coastlands and cobalt coastlands version are references the diamond and pearl route 210 track and while fits diamond and pearl tracks doesn really fit the feel you get the cobalt coastlands which nice chill day the beach but with pinch danger the music has more sprint the adventure ahead sort feel there are also times where felt that the battle wild pokémon track got bit repetitive maybe there were slight variations depending where you were that would made lot better there was also this one trainer battle that wish had some more dramatic music instead the normal trainer theme all these are nit picks though and didn the way enjoyment much overall hope that generation and future legends titles there are any improve upon this and make something truly great there promise here 
617,although this game good one compared bdsp not understand how people can call played the game around hours and have say the only thing that makes this game enjoyable are the mechanics the story solid best and the graphics are truly horrific fan old games and dont care about graphics but visual bugs and disappearing assets are truly bad its shame because botw manage graphics way better its not about the switch rather than the game 
618,you all probably know what good about this game already ahead and just list some negatives that have impacted overall impression subpar graphics breath the wild looked way better than this back when was released five years ago low framerate best but often far below that the camera constantly shifting its own and there way make stay place empty world aside from pokémon wandering around and some farming points there nothing else find anywhere trainers points interest treasure chests etc you can switch pokémon inbetween turns battle story npcs and wild pokémon can fight you using several pokémon once but you stuck using single one even those battles having isn uncommon unless you fine with wasting precious money buy poké balls you have craft your own this turn means that you end having farm resources which more than little tedious actually add complete entry for pokémon your pokédex you need fulfill som criteria like catching certain number that pokémon defeating certain number that pokémon and might seem like fun addition paper but being forced more less the same tasks over and over and over again for every single pokémon gets annoying pretty quickly the flying mount isn actually flying but rather just gliding making borderline useless for travel unless you start off high plateau clunky controls while riding mount even you close enough enemy focus that doesn mean your poké ball will reach you often few inches off alerting the pokémon your presence and potentially make turn aggressive lot pokémon have very long aggro range making them impossible approach unless you sneak them from behind sneaking extremely slow the pokémon you approaching will most likely have turned around and noticed you the time you close enough actually hit with ball you hiding grass and throw poké ball that then fails catch pokémon you noticed and probably attacked that pokémon even you still hidden and should impossible find boss fights against frenzied yellow pokémon are godawful the dodge mechanic clunky best and the window opportunity for sending pokémon fight the boss after been injured enough frustratingly narrow unless you basically the same second the message pops screen the poké ball will just bounce off and the boss will recover what this means that you usually stuck slowly whittling away the boss entire with throwable items 
619,okay first off hate the hand holding the start this game not fun but pretty worth the full price art not game 
620,the new mechanics and the direction which this installment moves the franchise are very enjoyable however the game seems unfinished the missions are repetitive and the visual section gets the way the enjoyment the game this delivery has value and enjoyable for the changes introduces but weighed down the constants sloppiness the visual section and development missions narratives too simplistic and repetitive 
621,changing the review put score first because the first hours with the tutorial was terrible like everyone had like years old but after that the game improves not technically course because terrible but related gameplay and fun not that bad nothing revolutionary here maybe for the franchise yes but not gaming general nothing that games did many years ago but better you are fan the franchise enjoy but just average 
622,pokémon slowly turning into cheap jrpg the graphics are shockingly bad with very poor frame rate the tutorial lasts for over hour and that with rushing through dialogue the game interrupts you constantly from playing force you through bland and generic npc cutscenes with forgettable characters that have nothing interest say the world barren and has very little atmosphere and nothing worth exploring people that excuse this game deserve the mess that update you can stick out for few hours more then the game lets the training wheels off you and you can start have some fun still not great 
623,this new pokémon game has interesting concept but the fresh air not that well executed exploration quite nice although not the best open world gameplay graphics however are bland and outdated looks like 3ds years ago which pretty disappointing since the let games were very good looking better than sword and shield but still low pokémon list and nintendo switch list suggest you buy end year start 2023 when its discount bland but still little bit fun 
624,step forward steps back brilliant diamond got lot crap but some the quality life updates made that game made have some the most fun ever had pokémon game really thought features like accessing from anywhere and infinite bag space was forecasting what would have going forward the series nope they decided make those things more restrictive than ever collecting items craft what need tedious and intentionally time consuming clearing bag because can hold anything else incredibly frustrating those are the biggest things making this game less enjoyable than could but there much more could mention felt like spending hours typing out not bad game but could much better 
625,pros decent story fun gameplay restructure pokedex log tasks that are intuitive and entertaining crafting mechanics that tie into open world gathering you get ride menagerie impressive pokemon and the platforming decent new evolutions for old favorites slick battle animations item management survival aspects with punishing consequences stealth mechanics that add another layer skill catching and battling wild pokemoncons short establishing new camp farming plot all side quest rewards are virtually useless and few them will require unpleasant amount your time accomplish sloppy lazy gameplay padding the game has very little content compared other entries the series hours postgame has little purpose just dex grind multiplayer pvp there only handful trainer battles battles will wild pokemon encounters boss fights are essentially janky unmemorable minigames mediocre graphics that have excuse for running the system hot while looking badverdict clear that the game albeit somewhat successful market test wait until they release multiple dlcs just buy sword shield you haven already 
626,there lot really like but there might just tad more that dislike idk were give rating probably like overall fun but mechanics get bit boring after little and the story and graphics are worse than games from years ago the story doesn get interesting until you like the last arc the game love what they did with the game and they were expand upon sequels the legends subseries will certainly preferred way play pokemon but stands idk 
627,pokemon legends arceus had great deal potential leading release but the end product sadly lacking nice see major attempt revitalize the age old formula that remained largely unchanged since the gameboy but the execution muddled catching pokemon real time feels great alongside the overhauled battle system but the content arceus simply too repetitive enjoyed the long term the open world environments are only really fun explore the first time around the variety really lacking and the pokedex system requiring multiple captures and interactions with the same creature makes the experience bit slog the style the game initially appealing game set the distant past the sinnoh region conceptually very compelling unfortunately arceus fails live premise and world and environments tend totally without life and character there only single proper town and there very little the way meaningful interaction here the graphics are noticeably subpar for official nintendo release with plenty minor visual bugs distract you from the experience the story another letdown throughout the game considerable length nothing note really happens very basic set events but the game can help itself from including walls upon walls text the characters are really not all memorable and only serve basic story functions before being left the wayside this shame many the characters are really well designed and several represent the ancestors characters from diamond and pearl which pretty interesting concept shame that they feel like such throwaway element the experience although was initially quite excited learn about the world legends arceus takes place this enthusiasm quickly fizzled over the game playtime and the story petered out disappointingly obvious and expected way wish that could separate the disappointing parts arceus from promising new gameplay formula but that simply not possible the new gameplay style could great new direction for the series but simply too repetitive this current iteration compelling past the first few times you experience also major letdown see how utterly lifeless the world characters and story are these elements had the potential legitimately compelling and explore the world sinnoh exciting new ways legends arceus probably worth checking out you fan the series and want see new take the gameplay formula but don expect much more than that 
628,without doubt step the right direction the open world approach simply the correct way with such franchise looks awful the pop terrible some textures are legitimately ps2 quality you look the sky and then look your feet the frame rate drops considering that breath the wild 2017 game can run much better looking much more stylized world with much better performance the switch this just embarrassing the pokemon the wild don seem much all and are not organic compared deer red dead redemption will not told compare this game with botw rdr2 because pokemon makes money every goddamn year simply the biggest franchise ever think bigger than gta rdr zelda star wars marvel etc they are bound deliver something better their fans doesn even have voice acting because they don want spend the money what want see next time fully open world not different sections here with actual people and towns and buildings actual missions and quests other than catch this many pokemon those are just fetch quests all pokemon included animated and full character battles gyms badges and pokemon league with good better resolution textures frame rate and overall performance before that just cannot give this positive score 
629,pla fun game that really rough around the edges there are parts the game that make kinda want the game get with and parts where was actually engaged with the story with that said the game play felt very bare bones and repetitive making wish that there was more story 7for pokemon game the story this one actually pretty decent even though feel they had use leaps logic for why people act why conflict sometimes happen order progress the story forward which isn bad thing just isn groundbreaking its own right just happy have stakes pokemon game again sound 6there wasn much music that really stood out mostly because swear couldn hear overthe pokemon the wild the ending song really good though graphics agree with everyone else that the graphics the game itself isn really that good and for the largest media franchise the world they could have stepped them but the end the day could have been lot worse than actually got game play 6the game play fun the beginning but the main issue with the fact that pretty much the same thing throughout the entire game with the only break the monotony being the boss fights which were genuinely fun fight against because wasn just regular pokemon battle final score 10pla step the right direction for the pokemon franchise and really want see what they next with this type game play style even this instalment feels extremely bare currently 
630,nice gameplay you can see the evolution the series but disgusting technical condition and art design 
631,this game takes players extraordinary adventure ancient japanese themed world pokemon where you get the chance befriend the legendary pokemon arceus let hope everyone forgot about pokemon conquest can make that sound more original fair don hate this game think this great reimagining sinnoh its not the remake wanted but still had pretty good time was hesitate first discovering that the final sinnoh remake was going spin off game really disappointed mean let the catching mechanics are vastly different compared other games but they were easy learn and its lot like the original pokemon games where everyone could learn reflect but this whole new pokemon world brand new catching mechanics and altered battle system all diverse and while the battle system best really impressed with the new catching mechanics stalking careless pokemon the tall grass like true hunter and then smashing them the back for the capture its really satisfying definitely the game biggest strength this game definitely isn for battle fans but was rather designed for those who love complete the pokedex world with version exclusives and trade items are equivalent evolution stones nothing holding you back this time catch all those pocket monsters personally favorite part this experience was probably the alpha pokemon they remind some old pokepark memories only these pokemon aren pissed off they want tear you shreds exhilarating trying catch these guys they roar loud that its sends your character flying the added size and the glowing red eyes really adds intimidation looks lot like the classic mystery dungeon box art just gives another reason love them they are over leveled and are strong most legendaries which makes all the more satisfying build team out them you know how awesome build team made alpha sinnoh starters like dream come true and also shout out the reason call this reimagined sinnoh because you listen carefully you can hear remixed level themes from diamond and pearl all across the game eterna forest coronet the works the celestica flutes sound just like the old title screens and there plenty sinnoh pokemon set nice familiar tone the game like the new pokemon forms fine but puts greater smile face see hundreds sinnoh pokemon spread across the land including the platinum entries yes move over half asked diamond and pearl remakes this how its done well for the most part the game great even with half broken controller and few sprite glitches was still having fun ride but the charm the characters started wear off after defeated avalugg bet lot people question this part when they back the game why the hell does commander kamado kick you out the village for some reason suddenly accuses you the child suffering from amnesia who has been doing nothing but help team galaxy and save the nobles for causing the distortion threatening the region hisui this point the game lot scene the story feel forced the commander suddenly turns into antagonist and there some extra backstory for the charm sisters and just don care some the boss fights this game were annoying and not fan all the side quests but those are just nitpicks rpg game doesn need breathtaking story good but kamado motivation childish feels like the writers just made his character antagonist because the first climax wasn exciting enough this just weak sword and shield antagonist and for volo the true villain have ask did anyone care the final fight takes place after the main story credits most players are likely miss out its not really built well and sadly like the new cynthia the remakes the developers make this fight unnecessarily difficult order entertain older fans like difficult pokemon challenges but you really think the battle system was highlight this game the game starts feel smaller when started climb mount coronet not putting the effort remake the distortion world summit level longer was huge missed opportunity can listen the sweet remix the level one takes minute climb the main gimmicks are lot more entertaining than the conclusions the characters are vibrant dit feels good build team favorite pokemon but this game really needs something more wants remembered hopefully the dlc this time around will worth purchasing because this the most fun had with modern pokemon game years hope that gamefreak will return greatness someday one step time 
632,the underrating shouldn not everyone only e10 what with the rating pending and this could harmful for little children the story like parental guidance and the gameplay like monster hunter world rise like open world zone the game frame rate not enough adjust 60fps and 1080p and the graphic too similar sword and shield however the music open world area and quests that like much better like music was very calm and peace that can relax brain without expressing anger can believe you don have enough strong graphic and frame rate because very disappoint that you put low quality even though you compared the breath the wild the only you compare monster hunter world and monster hunter rise this hub system the battle mechanic not bad strong and agile much combination but confuse about the turns also the moves were too small disappoint that all the moves about are gone the difficulty battling tricky and everyone thing they can win higher level like post ending will start over without check point the modeling doesn make sense like pokemon has different colors and confusing think shiny more trade evolve yay the fans think the trade evolve would get stolen and refuse give back impress you add new items like linking cord returning quest the money too low and the rank progress too slow when progressing the story also wasting poke balls that you catch limit amount and you waste and buy again think the game freak using the same graphic that the aaa are having technical issues rather than finding good engine create their own themselves also wasn not much fun with multiplayer 
633,nice game compared the last pokémon gamesa but the graphics are poor and the game has improve lot this the way 
634,this game definitely step the right direction however gamefreak now needs build this foundation need more settlements interesting locations better told story with voice acting maybe more interactions with the world especially the pokemon pros finally step forward for the pokemon franchise fun action centric boss battles catching pokemon feels great way better difficulty spike than older gamescons horribly bad storytelling even more handholding than monster hunter game the world feels liveless and the pokemon not interact with eachother boring environments there are secrets other than the ones you have discover for the story 
635,playing legends arceus was fun game freak finally tried something new improved the gameplay make feel faster and some more positive things its the right direction for the pokemon franchise and hopefully bunch improvements will find there way the main pokemon games good the gameplay story and direction was you cant ignore the technical and graphical problems about this game and should called out and criticized the art style not the problem looks really good when you find the right camera angle when you look the world pokemon legends arceus and compare similar games with their worlds like monster hunter rise the switch even other exclusives like xenoblade pokemon snap the upcoming kirby game and zelda botw and many more legends arceus looks awful this game steam pre alpha game even n64 game when you compare some areas with zelda ocarina time there are lot pop ups trees etc the main town the only one game and most houses are just copy and paste awful environmental visuals lot areas feel very empty and there are also nearly points interests for game that wants you explore the world course there need have game with next gen graphics more realism look but you have have mind that this game product big video game company with the biggest franchise the world they generate millions dollars and cant deliver game with visual standard that fits the size and popularity the franchise pokemon game freak has the finances get help other studios like every game does nowadays even halo horizon etc gets help many different studios the console not the problem you can see all the way better looking exclusives the switch and when there lot crunch time its company decision put the games the market high frequency with just the essential content and visuals get enough positive scores media and the games sold overall the game makes quite fun because uses fresh optimized gameplay and going another way than the main games but you have decide you want spend your money for game that looks like game that stucked the past the xbox360 ps3 era even some point lower compared other actual games feels like completely low effort product with details and soul the end its decision whether you want support this course the company game freak want see way bigger change the biggest franchise the world 
636,the game promising but not really worth full the graphics are poorly optimized still sword shield actually looks better promising change the battle system with exception you the trainer moving around thus taking out the multiplayer was completely unnecessary dumbed down 242 pokes the region which may upset alot other trainers catching mechanic lacks potential cut the middle man between traditional lets stealth mechanic poor better off just catching foot battle story average pokemon story with minor grim tales abilities natures longer thing but evs ivs are still the game despite competitive battles 
637,legends arceus expensive tech demo through and through through the past several years the transition from sprite work models gamefreak made the risky move turning pokemon into console title with that shift has come noticeable drop quality particularly the department which manages the compatibility between titles sword and shield had reduced pokedex and rather sparse content and legend arceus follows suit delivering really unique playstyle overshadowed game generally devoid content the ancient world sinnoh bland and misses lot the diverse biomes that typically populate pokemon game top generally feeling empty whole you love pokemon you probably still enjoy this game did but can shake the feeling this game should released free demo with the team dedicating more time fleshing out the world the missions and the overall pokemon experience not sure gamefreak just looking for cash grab has just grown plain lazy but legend arceus will hopefully not set precedent and just paving the way for much better game down the road 
638,good idea terrible execution pokémon tried innovate game that seems made with absolute lack love for the franchise even though includes some nice additions the classics formula keeps repeating some its most classic mistakes not even going mention the art direction and the graphic issues because everybody has seen can still can very enjoyable experience though but this definitely not the best pokémon game years not even close extra points for the effort put trying innovate but shouldn praise game freak for making game that feels unpolished and sometimes even unfinished 
639,its half baked game for price aaa game feels like game from 2005 voices just text cant jump cant pass terrain graphics horrible just bad textures effort make some art cant render proper graphics you would expect 120fps switch with graphics bad this but think its barely pushing world has lot pokemons thrown but besides feels rather empty sense wonder while exploring just dull you can read good stuff from other people making going into good direction better then previous doesn make good game 
640,love the game for the first hours game play really fun and the interaction with the pokémon are really good but when reaching the later areas starts feel bit repetitive and empty understand that the world supposed feel empty but this too empty the graphics not good normally would not mind but feels unfinished for the hype this game got and the fact that pokémon one the biggest franchises for nintendo kind disappointed had higher expectations 
641,the game over all breath fresh air and truly like the direction going the story decent the controls nice and the pokémon don seem bland they were previous pokémon titles fun but fan the series for years can not ignore the many inconsistencies npcs sometimes moving their mouth while talking and sometimes not for the uninspired landscapes and caves specifically the horrific graphics especially light and shadow work and lilac shimmer the ground for apparent reason and framerate the annoying repetitive dialogue the pokémon glitching trees and the jokingly bad render distances multi billion dollar company the year 2022 the gameplay however really fun not perfect but fun and really hope the next legends game will improve the things clearly lacks off right now great potential 
642,visuals are improvement but still very bad for game 2022 game play fun first but gets very repetitive catching trash pokémon over and over again 
643,this game was breath fresh air that pokemon players needed gamers and content became very repetitive great ideas let hope gen for moving and expanding our expectations for good pokemon game 
644,this game step new and exciting direction but the world feels eerily dead and unfinished for example there severe lack music when running around the map the pokemon just stand around staring into space instead playing chasing each other the pokemon species all just kind spawn groups certain spots without much variation the graphics are rather poor you can finish the main story about hours like with most pokemon games its too easy there are some cool things about though especially the open world aspect there are also fairly challenging events with rare pokemon shiny pokemon catch and quite few legendaries catch enjoyed but yeah something about the emptiness really puts off the game 
645,let say good experiment but the battles are mess little amount you can avoid almost any battle you want doesn make any sense pokémon all over again you catch them all and that all you don need train them because even bosses can beaten without even using single pokémon and the joke that they all are wining experience even you didn use them battle system mess and left much desired like enemy pokemon poisoned use calm mind buff myself for the next pokémon their pokemon use agile style and attack their pokemon die poison and another comes new pokemon uses quick attack new pokemon uses agile style attack new pokemon attacks again and when turn finally here calm mind effect expired joke understand now why there held items abilities they surely need improve this future games also story bland the postgame epic but doesn makes much sense and the tutorial the longest this franchise has don get wrong liked the game because catching and exploring are done better than ever and that makes this game really fun play far the best part this game but the rest just meh 
646,game was really fun first due novelty got really boring really fast struggling stay awake most the time the story very bad don let others tell you otherwise backwashed horses semen just bottom the gutter story items are annoying item storage even more only hope have for this that there are more than zones and hopefully some free patches could back time wouldn have bought this this pokémon game was last one just don think pokémon for anymore 
647,gets very repetitive and locks the main story behind level grinding for game called pokemon legends has very little legendaries the catching super fun but the battling broken and not fun fighting people feels abusive fight wild pokemon 
648,this average game running around the world and catching pokémon dream come true since was little kid the first time experienced this was with pixelmon now must say this game ugly horrendous textures and lod pop ins landscape blur with details from the ps2 era guessing all budget went into animations animations are solid moves looks good pokémon idle alright and the models are some the best for the story there one nothing exciting like past pokémon games very basic for people rating this perfect 100 100 are insane for the ones giving this this very average game which think honest review hopefully game freak evolves with this and step away from their past safe zones recommend buying and playing the game 
649,the game very fun first but the luster wears off badly goes initially rated the game but you play you see the ugly visuals battling terrible this game the style system horrible barely any moves lots battles where you versus multiple pokemon that can all potentially have multiple turns each before you can even anything you can send pokemon and have die without even moving slow because the styles the boss battles are mess the first couple are fine but the 3rd you start wonder what the designers were thinking certain attacks are basically impossible dodge and goes against the idea the game being more simple spoiler example arcanine whole thing dashes across arena with lava and you have leave enough space dodge him fine then just puts massive fire ring the middle the arena that completely blocks anywhere dodge sideways tackles but you the ring you die mechanic that makes sense and just feels frustrating and cheap because doesn require you react dodge more you just can move out the way his attacks that point but just dodging tackle still like they took all the fun and complexity out the actual pokemon battles but the boss fights are nightmare poorly designed attacks try dodge while throwing balms there are also lot small irritating things like save file how small the satchel game where you supposed constantly gathering things the game fun when you just out catching pokemon but has huge laundry list problems that only pokemon could ever get away with like any other company game series would dragged for game with this many issues and outdated systems 
650,graphics anren very good swear there are reused assets from phantom hourglass this game sound ain good either most the music sounds like elevator music and the sound lack any energy pacing extremely slow the game holds you the hand the entire time and there far too much text read gets boring quick not much variety the world not alot depth the combat you aint doing much either character desings are seeing pokemon moving around kinda cool 
651,the graphics are objectively terriblethere voice gruntingtons and tons dialog and cutscenesit not really open world more like sections open areasthe music uninspiredboss fights are boringthe first hours are trudgefeels like fan made gamegameplay loop alright and the crafting coolit tries mimic the botw charm and falls far short originality gameplay graphics music animation bugginess performance controls etc all mean you pokemon fan you going get this but you are just thinking about getting into pokemon this game will probably disappoint 
652,mediocre game does get some things right like the seamless battles and quality life when comes changing movesets but otherwise this step back empty ugly world where the battles matter very little since you can just stealth and throw the ball everything even when you get into one the few trainer battles they are too offense based any fun thanks the new system this only good game you just like catching pokemon and nothing else but that point why not just play too much was sacrificed like developed region with towns and the ability battle others online 
653,gameplay boring you just throw your pokeballs the pokemon and that the bosses are just orrible the graphics even worse 
654,lazy reskin the botw area with low preforming grapichs and bland overview really wanted like the game but just sloppy overall job they should just have taken one more year and polish the world afraid this game will what pokemon releases before have done get with great score and then reduced because the nostalgia has worn off 
655,non existent plot repetitive gameplay 2006 graphics the only thing throw balls the pokemon 
656,for game that compares itself monster hunter and breathe the wild doesn live the expectations the frame rate and graphic makes look like very solid ps3 game hoping gets patches and rating will honestly only game pokemon fans would okay with 
657,overall for pokémon game the changes they made were exactly what have been waiting for for years the issues start once you realize though this not open world game and technically even less open world than previous games they straight stole the world system from monster hunter where you have central hub filled with npcs you can converse with merchants and crafting capabilities which they didn really even use recipes they already have for example only brown apricots are the game preventing the acquisition pokeballs such the love ball premier ball and then exploration zones which are just wild area from sword and shield but larger the alpha pokémon are just permanent weaker versions dynamaxing which nice but not really anything new they are supposed come with special moves but those same moves can just bought from the move trainer for money money never thought pokémon game would make money redundant but wasted first million just buying moves for pokémon ended releasing back into the wild eventually some recipes cost money and can costly upwards 000 far but made million before even quelled the first noble you don need buy pokeballs potions their upgraded versions cause you can just craft them bag space kind expensive after awhile but after the first upgrades never had issue with running out space before needing rest and recover the game isn even anywhere close open world the central hub separated loading screen between every region regions which you can not travel between without going back the central hub and walking into buildings causes loading screens that closed world they have wild pokémon spotting where group something specific will spawn larger numbers but that only happens region time and only when you back the central hub they also have these things called time distortions which summon evolution items stronger pokémon perfect for level grinding and coloured plates and star dust which can crafted together into star pieces but only will spawn region time afterwards you forced back the central hub again you want more these spawn before going back town your also forced turn all your currently finished research which gives you money and towards your star rank the star ranks what was the purpose these was star and all pokémon all levels would obey command before even quelled kleavor that the equivalent gym badges previous games which means time actually got into the mirelands every one pokémon which collect each one their alpha form and shiny forms were all hitting everything including the noble the mirelands the miss fortune sisters and all the trainers trainers where are all trainers rushed unlock braviary and now stopping actually perfect the dex but like where are the trainers you fight handful leaders and wardens the diamond and pearl clan and even give out balls and pokémon people start them out but the only real trainer encounter the miss fortune sisters who ambush you from time time where follower pokemon like seriously yellow heartgold soulsilver lets these were some your best games because the follower pokémon stop removing that feature combat evolved noticed and love the fact that you went out your way and removed redundant moves such harden and condensed them into their other more significant abilities like iron defense but where the pokémon combat this would have been perfect game allow control our pokémon during battle and combat like rpg instead turn based dodge block attack all that could have easily been done instead being able run around during combat the trainer kind redundant there and little useless for feature although yes did say this was the game been waiting for for years have lower rating because the fact they keep removing features their series that actually did very well and attracted people their game all all have spent over 100 hours the game already and have perfect 115 242 available currently hopefully with future updates and dlc they can fix some issues and maybe try and actually make open world game not just claim one and steal the concept from someone else 
658,predicted same stupid director same stupid game unfortunately the fanboys will never admit they think they can call themselves gamers because they like pokemon lol predicted knew gamefreak was going use the timeline excuse not add gyms trainers championship less directing needed not nintendo fault just that sadly gamefreak owns part the pokemon franchise 
659,okay game but gamefreak could better the total game content not satisfying should more from pokémon company 
660,would nice put the budget use from time time actually would the first time ever game freak actually utilized the budget just speechless the only way could start enjoy this game was imagine myself kid again being affirmative anything pokemon related you have practically stuck the 2000s appreciate this game just don know what say garbage game 
661,the game fun but cking ugly jesus christ have indiferent hate relationship with the progression 
662,solid baseline for the future but the game lacks some fundamentals features the story and the graphics are really terrible but overall the game funny for future chapter with several improvement could think give better score but today the game still under the 
663,honestly will say this game really apreciate the zelda way attitude but game freak need pratice more graphics not really good and movement physics little inaccurate you cannot swim little you cannot check your life stamina positive that they try make the boss fight more fun with another way fight but overall mediocre game but improvement over the old games the past 
664,honestly overall not bad game the graphics are that nintendo game and can count how many graphical errors ran into however the mechanics and new battle styles are honestly really cool and have lot fun battling although the story seems pretty shallow and not super well thought out which nothing new for pokemon game honest overall think definitely worth playing but not worth the price tag 
665,good step forward for the brand but with ridiculous quality gamefreak should leave the technical development the game third parties 
666,here out love pokémon been playing for over years all the mainline games but have honest and objective myself been playing and playing and playing for hours bad game not all but don think good either main complaint battles they are completely ruined the system just all over the place there absolutely balance hate the new styles never use them pokémon battle attack you twice something just because styles used sometimes even times abilities would help with battles but they don exist etc just feel like battles are complete mess and that wild pokémon battles because proper battles with trainers don exist you have some battles every years with trainer who uses freaking pokémon the areas are too big imo not bad thing but extremely confusing and sometimes annoying and lose interest exploring because everything the same but with different pokémon walking around know some people love massive open areas but not cup tea like something more the middle the crafting annoying way worse the satchel limit that you have pay ton money get just more spot for item wtf won talk about the graphics all know they not the best and they didn really bother for was other stuff that was worse than that mentioned before there way too much talking nonsense talking way too much find dumb you can from one area the other you have back the camp every single time request the village and then again request another area that just dumb and waste time can believe they pulled this you can change pokémon and access your objects store them mandatory back the camp again not much qol there and don even get started losing ton objects when you pass out absolutely miss battles real ones absolutely miss gyms having more marked objective and the pokémon league etc some people may like the type game legends but pokémon has been always about battles gyms the league and being pokémon master the best play when bored when stop playing takes lot for back the game doesn really hook force myself play least finish game wasn for free have say love the overworld pokémon and the possibility see shynies like the battling when you just send the pokémon and that very quick and appreciate that personally hope this just the typical spin off game hurts admit had way more fun with sword and shield hope gen takes the good mechanics about this game like the overworld pokemon quick and out battles etc but more focused the typical gyms etc and not massive areas the best pokémon game everrrr some people say hell not even the main essence the franchise not bad but not the best either least not for give back competitive battles and gyms would give 
667,the game took whole new direction different setting the visuals are much improved and the gameplay rather addictive truly feels like how pokemon should have always been exploring and seeing pokemon the wild 
668,ign italy review the most accurate critic review this game that reviewer understands how analyze game systems and how they interact with one another instead just being mindlessly wowed open world with few genuine improvements the traditional pokémon formula and there really are some improvements they simply seem have been made without any consideration whatsoever for how they affect the rest the game let start with the good non random seamless battles are great want get into fight with wild pokémon toss out one your own pokémon near and bam you battle loading screen battle transition effect just instantly battle mode and you still free move around will while the battle going see from any angle even get hit the attacks you careless with where you stand don feel like battling you can catch pokémon without being battle now which great not all them mind you but some them these are the two main alterations game freak made the traditional formula they good ideas unfortunately they have some noticeably bad knock effects which seems game freak either didn notice compensated for rather amateur ways previous pokémon games had the luxury hiding all pokémon tall grass and outside sword shield never actually showed them the wild this means the presence the pokémon part the player suspension disbelief they there and they totally have all the behaviors listed the pokédex but you just never see them legends arceus the other hand shows the pokémon the wild and they just stand there and wander around bit they don live the world they have homes they have behaviors they don interact with one another they simply exist and wait caught fought this much more than the obvious visual fidelity issues makes the world feel lifeless and oddly empty out battle catching speeds the game insane extent you could catch everything without fighting the game would over extremely quickly and game freak needed not let that happen because the large number people out there who equate time spent with money value seems game freak has implemented two solutions order prevent the game runtime from being drastically shortened first pokémon fall into three categories friendly skittish and aggressive friendly pokémon can caught out battle with special requirements just throw ball skittish pokémon can caught out battle long they don see you first they run away aggressive pokémon cannot caught outside battle whatsoever and must fought and captured the traditional manner game freak has made most pokémon aggressive they made super convenient change the formula and then set things force you through the traditional formula anyway for the most part secondly and far more damningly the pokédex requires multiple catches multiple victorious battles multiple observations pokémon move use and other checklist items such catch without being seen before dex entry for specific pokémon will complete there really reason justification provided for what amounts repetitious busywork seems obvious that this another solution the problem made playing the game faster and more convenient but need keep them playing for roughly the same amount time before catching faster now require lot more catches instead just the traditional one and done battling controllable now and not all randomized require specific number battles for each pokémon the player has fight them multiple times anyway and worse virtually everything the game revolves around dex completion which never gets any more interesting complex over time sidequests ask for complete dex entries outright for things you complete dex entries the main quest also requires dex entries one note game loop game freak could have done much more interesting things with its good core changes make the pokémon appear really live the world require the player observe and record their behaviors what they eat where they live use the switch the dex itself similar how botw treated the tablet actual game device and permit the player directly record dex info perhaps with fill the blank fields and selection pre written answer options game where the dex central interesting things with the dex seem like brainer unfortunately game freak settled for just make them the usual stuff but way more the end result decidedly repetitive lackluster game hope game freak figures out where went wrong here really isn hard see the holes 
669,this had good graphics would goty doesnt get repetitive really nice game 
670,open world like game graphics are one the main features plays very important role cannot and must not ignored this title sold only because pokemon otherwise title with such technical scarcity nobody would have bought let take off the fanboy mask and let look well what have hand game that moves the foundations and renews these titles fun intriguing etc but want talk about the game world square hills types trees copy paste for the whole map zero dungeons cross tunnels with the same texture everywhere undriveable mounts camera that leaves for its cabbages mountains that change shape you move away tall grass made with the strips that rotate with the camera telecameraand could and for such title find absurd and offensive towards those who put effort and love into creating their own games 
671,one step ahead two behind they could have done just little more and this could have been the new standard for pokemon game gameplay wise 
672,while refreshing see pokemon open environments its ridiculous that people are raving about this game one the worst looking games switch the world bland empty and the pokemon just shuffle around and dont feel alive the volume and repetition catching pokemon lessens your attachment your team pokemon the highest grossing video game series ever and deserve better people are giving this and zelda mario game was released with this quality and lack ambition would get terrible review new snap and the diamond pearl remakes were both bigger files and shows the lack attention detail arceus 
673,good you are pokémon fan but this game made another company nobody would play the gameplay interesting but the only thing the story poor and the tutorial never ends 
674,been playing pokemon since emerald and yes like the step that they going with this game but out sheer love for the franchise just can not ever recommend this game considering how much costs and the actually quality and quantity you getting was hoping able give pass the horrid graphics the world itself had something compelling but what got was sloppy excuse mish mash terrain right now can even bare finish the game doesn keep hooked especially not with how grindy the progression feels the research part great and certainly something most fans wanted but putting the only way progress the story just makes feel like chore gamefreak don want catch this pokemon for 267th time progress this subpar story and moving the story was alright but again that damn research system shouldn the main part just like the pokedex previous games should just been side objective that you slowly progress you play through the game not vice versa now let talk about the world you could even call that you know what the open world feels like like they spat face and said deal with let ask everyone else who played can you name atleast places the map and say something interesting about them take away the pokemon roaming around and ask yourself was any the wilderness area memorable the answer noand now the roaming pokemon what else there say they basic ais that just happen look like pokemon not expecting complex simulation their ecosystem but they didn even try improve after swsh sword shield finally have reiterate love pokemon but things stand don think gamefreak feels the same love towards overall the game there are good ideas and least some hope for better game the future but right now pokemon legends arceus feels like unfinished half assed game with uncooked but great ideas better gamefreak better unrelated rant about parts the pokemon community like ordering steak gordon ramsay restaurant and getting raw beef you like steak but the chef didn bother cook you disappointed the result but you see everyone else eating the raw beef just because ramsay did you decide not eat the raw uncooked beef but everyone else the restaurant glares you because that what the community feels like nowadays criticizing the games cause want them better have ill intentions but everyone else feels and satisfied with the status quo while demonizing those who are actually passionate and love the pokemon games ones who want see reach full potential 
675,while many the latest pokemon games will introduce few new features tweaks but retain the same gameplay and story this takes whole new direction the gameplay wildly different and makes feel not like game you play but world you are part less step the right direction and more sprint highly recommend this anyone interested the series and look forward any future installments 
676,the best gane pokemon the shinyhunt its more easy and the open world increíble 
677,semi open world pokemon game the way the pokemon company lack affection for the saga worrying this game needs least one more year development but pokemon only cares about the money they know that will sell just the same even the game authentic graphic like this one also the game very repetitive and kind boring 
678,awesome new concept and had really high hopes the story interesting first but the game grindy and loses lot the pokemon charm cool new landscapes bonding with pokemon and not that many hidden secrets discover grindy and the visuals aren good all the pokemon want run fight interesting new direction but overall loses the fun 
679,all four the bosses were great the way you catch pokemon amazing every way awesome game 
680,really let down the gaming community inability give objective reviews was excited about this game from the moment heard about year ago really wanted like but watched through development saw red flag after red flag the game seems suffer from lazy open world design syndrome where the illusion endless opportunity boils down reveal game void meaningful content with redundant and scarce gameplay loops seeing the pokémon the overworld having more control over the trainer and their poke balls these are great ideas that get people excited but think about how much missing look the legendary open world games like tes gta and botw these games have their base gameplay loops slinging swords and sorcery stealing cars but they come together support epic overarching stories guilds colorful characters impactful decisions had lot fun with pokémon let and lot people complained about that think both the games suffer from lot the same problems hasty development lazy and uninspired technical issues didn see their predecessors but where are the negative reviews for legends wanted like arceus but this game clearly didn get the budget would have taken properly pull off this really great idea imagine guild plotlines like from tes but you working your way through gyms saving pokémon ranger refining your pokémon breeder imagine colorful characters sending you meaningful adventures and becoming your companions but get super boiled down game that feels like one two years development work from the team come gaming community tell with straight face this pokémon breath the wild that just insulting the team who put together the masterpiece that botw like saying honda with spoiler the japanese ferrari smhthat being said optimistic for this franchise going forward the massively positive response this game has seen despite its least obvious shortcomings should tip off the game makers that the community hungry for the types gameplay that arceus displayed maybe pay for this game but way 
681,quite like the game fun sunk hours into few weeks just seems under baked know going complete the game because enjoy but flawed the environment stale poor pop horrible for game about exploring biggest complaint the map there map the corner and find myself constantly opening the map and top that you can only place one guided marker time refreshing game not hard all that what you want but would recommend just because good but could have been much more just see decent base idea with flawed execution 
682,the first novelty that gave heaviness seeing all those items completed for each single pokémon the pokédex many are repetitive and although initially nice capture them they gave sense annoyance you can stay there for hours behind pokemon take them from behind catch them over and over again prefer the classic capture method that already miss while continuing seems always the first area everything the same from the first the last especially after 10h you start feel the weight the graphics the pasture full the same pokémon and after while you can longer distinguish there isn even tier order anything like that always talking about order can understand what the tools purse just the pokédex are quick powerful moves despite these facilities several times you not lose gain turn stand there each time press see who will attack that turn pokémon not obliged innovate did not like the news such moves having fill all those items especially because you not rise rank situation you cannot continue the story the graphics the clutter innovate the focus must creatures and the interaction with them above all don want rank get ultraballs etc and able catch strong pokemon limited and forced register pokemon repetitively wasting time just because cannot continueost absent except struggles and some situations with the powerful moves you lose all the beauty pokemon clashes with one move you knock out the pokemon and you finish everything quickly because then people have always complained about the difficulty game freak has decided get the exp points only the end the fight for makes sense just makes everything more difficult and frustrating because the pokemon not and many will 
683,wasn sure what make arceus when was first announced the one hand and tpc appeared changing the battle mechanics adding real time elements the other hand its poor graphics and empty overworld left lot desired was also unclear whether the game would experimental one off attempt change evolve the series core mechanics someone who played since the very first titles but finds the latest entries stale and disappointing went with very low expectations pokemon legends arceus trailers promised decent story and while can attest that the writing receives more focus than usual the presentation frankly sucks there still voice acting with most interactions consisting characters awkwardly standing talking the real draws are the revamped combat and catching systems the changes gameplay while not perfect make arceus initially far more captivating than its preceding games first and most importantly you can aim poke balls interact directly with pokemon the field while exploring you able easily shuffle who next line battle well send them harvest materials from trees shrubs and mineral outcroppings essential for crafting healing items and poke balls many pokemon will either run attack your avatar sight you got options dodge like dark souls sneak around and try nab them without being spotted ambush with your pokemon start fight lure repel them with food run away you also get multiple pokemon mounts ride across the game several open areas combat tweaked many minor ways while you dodging occasionally aside from bosses you don fight pokemon real time the traditional four move turn based core combat remains the game introduces agile and strong variations attacks faster and weaker stronger and slower best all your pokemon moves can now easily switched outside battle making infinitely more convenient swap movesets really opens lot possibilities you can have your starter sweeper one battle and defensive mon catching tool the next held items longer exist status effects are tweaked with most being weaker and they thankfully disappear after each battle these changes well the limited pool teachable moves make certain builds such dedicated physical and special sweepers far more effective your interest get battles done quickly possible especially since you often find yourself fighting multiple wild pokemon once with just one your own for the most part the changes also help the game flow smoother since you covering lot ground the great outdoors often atop mounted pokemon however due the kneecapping potential builds owing the removal breeding and lack variety your foes making fine tuning afterthought grew bored the battles halfway there are gyms breeding and very few trainer battles instead you spend time gathering crafting and the pokedex this time your dex entries don end with just catching and trading you also tasked with specific battle tasks you only need fulfill ten challenges per pokemon while isn daunting does feel like busywork that brings the game biggest weakness the world itself and don just mean the fact that there are limited ways interact with the environments that the 242 pokemon are mixed bag species while the pokemon models are often well animated the day night and weather cycles add variety and the game runs smoothly with minimal loading there sugarcoating the fact that the graphics and environments are subpar featuring empty worlds trees textures that would look bad the gamecube pop and heavy aliasing bland color palette tempered muted art direction testament the strength arceus core mechanics that the bland environments lack trainer battles and unfinished feel the game don completely sink the experience perhaps because expectations were low going but can safely say that spite its many faults arceus the most fun had with pokemon title since the days the also shows that the franchise general still has potential that may sound like faint praise from someone who has been critical the mainline franchise for years but think most fans will appreciate the real time elements the easily swappable movesets and the additions the world building and lore only hope that nintendo able build upon what was established this title and utilize take the franchise forward bold new direction rated balance out all the shills 
684,nice pokemon game wonderful for milking the brand after all looks good but purely terms gameplay all scheme nintendo releases pokemon game without really thinking about you don have creative anymore because will bought anyway 
685,while the story and new mechanics are truly amazing and mark great progress this old franchise everything let down the terrible engine the game which brings everything down the amount details terribly low framerates are well below acceptable resolution low and the game even docked mode looks and plays really bad the world simply empty and still the framerate dips quite often really sad because the new story mechanics and the whole idea for the game great can even blame switch for this state the game had the games like botw xenoblade that had really well made open world major disappointment considering that the pokemon games are always sell like crazy 
686,after completing the game and spending about hours sadly have say hard pass reply wanted like tried like but the only reason even beat the end was say did lot small things overall irritated thought out time playing this game that will excused cause not buggie other aaa titles will give all the credit the world for being playable but sad were age where that thing 
687,was hoping for pokemon finally catch with times but feels like they only developed game that should have been released years ago even further convinced that publishers developers pokemon games only aim milk nostalgic players and children who just started their adventure with pokemon minimum amount effort for maximum amount profits looks like has became the motto for while now still could enjoy bits and pieces but was falling asleep most the time 
688,tried play pokemon but still see lot room for improvement looking forward the next one 
689,don buy you really like pokemons and want game freak better the only way consumers can make the difference don get wrong not saying that every thing there terrible but players deserve better than this for what your currency you like gameplay loop play monster hunter you like open world play zelda you like pokemon battles play bdsp what have here nothing praised 
690,man the graphics this game are bad looks like ps2 game the gameplay not fun 
691,yall already know the graphics are really bad like unity terrain tutorials look betterits not really open world and you know that not the worst problemso you have like smaller areas with hub world but they somehow made this smaller areas really empty and blandbattle system boringcathing pokemon not the worst thing ever but gets old after whilecouldnt get more than hours before geting really boredand like thats fine but take break from all the crappy games that have come out the past years 
692,the maps and the graphics are downright ugly and disappointing think the catching mechanic lot fun but after the first hours enjoyment dropped off fast the lack trainer battles makes leveling and raising different pokemon virtually pointless there are some nice quality life improvements this game such the move select and evolution menu and the agile and strong style mechanic interesting but again the lack trainer battles makes this game have zero replay ability after you beat the main story 
693,wanted game not unpaid job looks average better than sword shield good for kids guess you desperate 
694,here game that paper gets excited for pokemon game after years and years the same repeated game with different skins comes new game that tries different the problem that each new idea feels cut short and never truly fleshed out the visuals are boring and flat people seem confuse graphics with things like ultra realism rtx but that not what speaking about game can have simple graphics but still manage set itself apart and look visually interesting this game needs voice acting some kind the lack voice acting just feels low budget and boring even grunt would bring point book this point the game play fun and would have enjoyed the open movement play bigger part the battles think are point where can start move away from the turn base battles final fantasy had great solution its remake where could toggled for those who enjoy but was not forced onto the player combat could much more doing real time heck even just getting rid the one pokemon limit when battling would improvement feels like they picked this time period that they could finally something different with the pokemon formula but then chose not lean into fully and are left with half baked new features that just leave wanting more hopefully this game will lead future where pokemon games can something more than just advertisement sell merchandise 
695,the pathfinding work the map really painful and don just focus the graphics come nintendo the world biomutant was more alive 
696,pokemon game but not good game the world feels empty graphics are outdated and pretty inconsistent the story and characters are weak even for pokemon game and once the novelty wears off the gameplay loop really repetitive this game really needed more time development create world worth exploring and refine all the new ideas but right now this feels like precursor great game and definitely not worth the price tag you enjoyed the games before have strong connection the franchise you likely enjoy and appreciate the changes but probably not winning over new fans hoping they actually take the time with the next one and run with the new ideas because could make for genuinely amazing game 
697,better than pokémon britian but could have been way better there whole lot useless empty space with nothing around catch interest looks like the environment department took the texture modeling budget while the buildings such looks good the character models did need more touch lighting reveals the models polygons occasion characters mouths continously open close like singing bass wall completing the pokedex tedious busy work now more than ever completion criteria random sometimes requires interactions with single type pokémon models visibly appear disappear when out rendering range pokémon animation visibly tanks frames distance the evolution animation the best and the music top notch 
698,good idea for game but horrible execution game just boring for the most part and story make sense 
699,are honest the graphic section leaves lot desired and even boring and cancine times the pokémon legends arceus understand that seems very good because the new fighting mechanics however they continue drag certain problems from the sword and shield series not deny that the game fun that are facing great game created game freak however could notice how this game was not made with the love and affection that accompanied the pokémon games 
700,long and boring tutorial poor plot and characters 2013 graphics and framerate there only good thing about the game pokemon game 
701,for person who has only played pokémon games for their entire life who are experiencing open world game for the first time this revolutionary this solid 100 you play many franchises even multi platform the game mediocre every way bunch good ideas terribly executed the game feels poor budget regardless the pokémon company being 100 billion dollar empire their product doesn reflect their power all you are just curious try pokémon this will fell just like what with fanaticism and biased thoughts mediocre basic and rough game get pokémon sword shield 
702,game that only pokemon fans would tolerate other game could this much technical disaster and still garner much praise only pokemon graphics sound design level design npcs and more are undercooked that would have guessed this game was year away from release the gameplay loop fun enough out into the zones and catch pokemon level them evolve them fill out your pokedex the same fun loop that pokemon built but opened larger zones not open world happy that many fans are enjoying this but wow that where praise ends the graphics are well documented being the worst any aaa game recent years hard overstate how bad they are this the ugliest major release any can remember there also voice overs even the typical jrpg grunting just silence during conversations the open zone level design nice change but marred the game ugliness not mention basic fun features like following pokemon the ability look your newly caught pokemon stats the field are absent npcs are also copy pasted across the game which sad considering there are maybe 100 them that just don understand how this game can celebrated pokemon fans deserve better there are early access indie games that are better optimized with better technical design than this last critique that the first hours incredibly boring but apparently this normal for pokemon games not recommend this game 
703,pokemon legends arceus failed experiment but solid and promising begining for new era the franchise let start with the good things the new set teams mechanic pretty good way that the movesets are changeable all the time which gives you the oportunity prepare difficult combats note there are not difficult combats but for the future way beyond interesting like the idea introducing new types attacks strong and agile the concept the pokemon missions addictive making the game more enjoyable trying complete the tasks your favorite pokemons capturing not favorite mechanic because rather combat but pretty satisfying and well done bad things the story and narrative dumb way that the characters are flattering you because you capture lvl2 pokemon and they couldn mean you where there for 5min and you did what they couldn for their entire life just ridiculous another dumb thing the professor character how the hell can someone professor you just can study the pokemons what can you teach ignoring all this the story just feels like anime issekai type story which not necessary that bad the game design generic pokemon always had charismatic look and don see nothing about this game the trees the towns and buildings etc just looks like generic f2p chinese game expect more from pokemon company the map looks pretty damn good though even the music generic the new roster pokemons from hisui despite arcanine are way worse designed than their original forms and arcanine not that better just feels different online pvp the stats from the pokemon are longer needed and thats pitty let finish with the more obvious all them the game looks really bad not only talking about the graphics which are way below from the standard the switch console not compare with botw game lauched 4years ago but you massive open world important that the ambientation and the world itself works hole order get inmersed 
704,things start off fun and exciting but quickly become redundant and monotone completing the pokedex overkill and after completing the game you wonder why you actually even bothered trying complete any the side quests giving you nothing but few additional resources the store joke you never actually have buy pokeball potion for the entirety the gamethe lack other villages towns the game pretty horrendous only another village and yet nothing worthwhile the storyline there other critics have mentioned the npcs are also blatantly empty the only worthwhile point this game the storyline and even there they could cut the chase the end instead adding double and triple plot twists completed the game and tossed completed game section may may not take out for dlcs any the future but really feels like dlcs should have been part the game the first place overall verdict borrow from friend complete the story and don bother complete the pokedex buying stuff doing side quests they give little addition the game 
705,looks like most reviewers only played the game for hours otherwise cant explain myself all these good ratingsgame looks like trash and after relatively short time everything just repeats 
706,pretty crazy what pokemon can get away with they switched the formula which imo definitely for the best however has been done poorly looks like still development and made small company with little income the graphics look crap there are few npcs pokemon just sit idling theyre not actually part the surrounding but just artificially placed there the gameplay loo 
707,imagine you working gamefreak and they tell you gonna completely change the formula and give the fans what they wanted and then you hear applauses and screams joy but then your boss tells you know this huge moment for and the fans but you have less than year develop this game because greedy and love money and you start thinking about your life choices well this game has proven that working gamefreak like wanting prestige restaurant chef and then end flipping burgers mcdonald how can you release such boring repetitive unoriginal and ugly game 2022 unskippable cutscenes awful story awful characters clunky movements clunky aiming system made fingers hurt for the first time since playing this console for years repetitive gameplay loop collect resources craft pokéballs catch pokémon repeat and worst all huge empty maps with nothing them how can you build fake open world game with activities besides catching pokémon and craft items the most basic craft ever seen entire life make empty and run barely fps 2022 console that has released xenoblades and botw the only reason don give this game because appreciate immensely the effort give the franchise new direction and breath fresh although smelly air this actually step into the right direction also loved the fact that the pokémon feel alive and the move animations are actually pretty slick but for that the game isn fun all pokémon fans need stop lowering the bar and amazed the low effort development this company brings stop letting them treat you you didn deserve more you give them millions every year and this what they reward you screw that man 
708,absolute garbage how anyone can rate this higher than beyond was already bored after the first hours and never wanted play again pretty decent pokemon fan but this game empty and dead and looks like playing and unfinished ps2 game literally thought was put into the art direction its all they did was raise the terrain random areas and splattered some copy and paste trees and called day the gameplay fun least and its finally something new and fresh and believe that they can build upon this and make better game the future but this aint chief 
709,the ingredients are there but combined incredibly lazy low effort way optimistic that they will continue try new things but this misses the mark polish story and variation gameplay 
710,the score above are pure fanboy the textures are terrible the tutorial very long you have meters from pokemon see why not doesn load the sound broken you can beat the game without fighting except for fights you can beat pokemons that take levels out you effortlessly the intention was good but they have made low budget breath the wild impact sad the part nintendo 
711,game that should have looked like this least years ago consider how much money gamefreak making from the franchise and end giving the fan such bad game the animations have once again been taken over from the 3ds game ultra moon and sword you work through checklists and have very few trainer fights was indie game would get out but this one the biggest franchises the world 
712,pros some music the design some pokemonbad technically unjustifiable pokemon are lifeless puppets wandering empty world without any level design devoid ecosystem unbalanced and unclear combat system banal and redundant story 
713,bare bones game decent gameplay mechanics but surrounded ugly graphics and bland story could far better and any fan that settles for this not helping the franchaise yes praise the good things the game the new things that they tried with the capture mechanics the combat etc but please say the truth average game most when you see the full picture let not make battle and can argue about giving the game from rating but anything else just unfounded hate fanboyism 
714,this could not game from 2022 looks like early gamecube game best its horrible looking why did buy this trash the open world gameplay nice and battling pokemon kinda fun but thats all there thats good and good size amout pokemon again this nintendo putting something out there where ppl playing ps4 ps5 are rolling off there chair laughing this game love nintendo death but this pretty bad yes its bad 
715,would pretty solid nintendo gamecube game nintendo switch game offensive the fans 
716,pokemon legends was extreme disappointment for was super hyped for this game lifelong pokemon fan but also rpg fan this game fell short expectations several different categories firstly the combat feels horrible they revamped the stats and combat system for pokemon legends but doesn feel good every move hits hard and you will often lose several pokemon battling wild pokemon you will almost always lose few when fighting alpha pokemon noble pokemon lot people seem think this makes the game more challenging but just made more frustrating still never blacked out lost entire party just had craft boatload revives and potions after each fight addition this they removed abilities from the game and instead added agile and strong style moves you can use agile perform and weaker attack strong for the opposite while this seems cool theory battles rarely ever last long enough reward using agile style personally feel like abilities made pokemon more unique and provided for more interesting combat experience overall tried avoid encounters with wild pokemon and catch them without entering combat possible secondly the story blows one the main appeals most rpgs their stories the witcher skyrim horizon zero dawn etc all have deep stories with plenty twists and turns that keep you engaged the story pokemon legends extremely vague and offers very little conclusion even upon full completion you basically kid who fell through space time distortion into ancient sinnoh where pokemon are going crazy upon completion the story and the entire pokedex you still haven figured out who you are and why you fell through the space time rift begin with third calling this open world rpg laughable the game extremely linear and you are bound certain areas until you complete the main quest this isn like skyrim fallout breath the wild where you can freely where you please and complete the story how you like there are meaningful choices involved all you can explore the areas you unlocked your heart content but there aren really any side stories anything the world bland and lacks depth there aren any cool puzzles hidden areas discover ultimately this just felt like different take the existing pokemon games certainly didn feel like the revolutionary open world rpg that was hyped lastly tried not judge this game too harshly off graphics and performance but unfortunately impossible overlook that aspect the game this game plays and looks worse than skyrim 2011 game there are fps drops that make the game laggy and feel bad regardless whether you play handheld docked know the switch isn very powerful system but sure ran breath the wild heck lot better overalll think pokemon legends cool idea with awful execution while was enjoyable times especially the beginning doing the same thing over and over got old pretty fast this game feels close being something awesome but falls short way too many crucial areas for warrant giving more than best unfortunately due the shockingly good reviews this game has gotten far don think game freak tpc will make efforts improve these areas the future and pokemon will continue downhill franchise 
717,leaving aside the pitiful graphics looks like game made without desire unfortunately disappointed what will the first pokemon game that will not complete 
718,fun the short term but doesn have much the way replayability even story despite the fact that supposed narrative driven most the game catching pokémon until time for you the same repetitive task calming the angry lord pokémon pokémon stranger repetition but less challenging than the pokémon gyms previous games those least had few trainers each different puzzles solve and gym leaders weren hard beat but you weren prepared you could lose just barely win the lord pokémon are much easier beat than gym leaders and much more tedious task you just throw balm battle throw balm battle again and throw balms you can skip the battles completely and just throw balms even dialga and palkia can cheesed just throwing balms and they some the final bosses the game there huge lack trainer battles the game you lucky see one every half hour say closer one hour unless you the few segments the game where you forced into back back battles there post game facility like virtually every other main series game after crystal and there are about 240 pokémon very few choose from regards team building subsequent playthroughs you can actually bring yourself replay the game you likely end using the same pokémon because there are few encountered the first areas there are decent number side quests requests the game calls them differentiate from the main quests missions but most them are simple fetch quests bring npc number item show them certain pokémon pokédex entry etc and there virtually multiplayer besides trading despite every other main series game having player player battles which never detracted from the single player experience the world also full barren fields mountains that have maybe pokémon screen best the time which inexcusable because the areas are relatively small compared other open world games using that term loosely for this game other games this nature you find settlements structures with characters who will give you quests you can explore dungeon such luck here you just keep walking seeing the same pokémon and plants over and over again the game mediocre best bad but not terrible worst know bad games because played the two worlds games and sonic really wanted like the game and hoped would good but was thoroughly let down pokémon sword and shield and pokémon brilliant diamond and shining pearl are miles ahead this game terms content replayability and following the concept the series whole 
719,common point that people make that graphics don matter all about style and gameplay well this game you don have visual quality but also looks artistically defunct the copy pasted houses the small village thing only few trees spaced out unnaturally using the same model and size the shiny flat textures the ground and people act like moving somewhat open space huge innovation when that has been standard thing for more than decade they are point where they can say pokemon game people will buy anything long pokemon game 
720,quick and easy review the story not bad all empty and lifeless world bad physics textures and framerate rough controls terrible typography the worst open world aaa you have hardcore fan like 
721,the first hours have been awesome but the exact same procedure ugly environments which are repeated the next areas the worst the story bad well the gameplay the animations the figures actually its pokemon stadium with better graphics shame for this game studio 
722,this game looks like beta not finished the technical section disaster has bugs very flat and the textures are not attractive all for all the money and support the company receives game made with very little desire the new mechanics aren much and the combat lacks any appeal need the company get its act together this saga will waste very disappointed 
723,this game has about hour tutorials you scream through them ton time useless dialogue and the worst offense all mmo mechanics use move times catch this pokemon times kill this pokemon times you have this progress the game you buy this game understand that money wasting timesink with some cool mechanics sprinkled remind you what could been 
724,pokemon legends arceus more tech demo that experiences with new mechanics and quality life features for the pokemon franchise than fully fledged aaa title pla main draw that attempts shakeup the pokemon formula modernizing the pokemon experience more closely match what pokemon catching would like the real world and how depicted the anime series there clearly some effort put forth here executing this new formula but just like almost every other recent iteration pokemon there are obvious signs neglect and corner cutting the most obvious signs neglect come from its lackluster visuals graphics aren everything sure but semi open world game where exploring the environment and catching pokemon the main draw how the world looks important aspect the overall experience not only are the graphics sub par when compared other titles the same console doesn even match the graphical quality games from years ago now sub par graphics are used make for hinderances due performance that can more understandable but that not the case here pla has much less taking place screen any given time than many other open world games and also not technically open world game each individual area you explore restricted sub set the overall world based what mission objective chosen from the town hub which also the only town you visiting given the restrictive nature the open world and its sub par graphics could still look better simply more was taking place screen for example there were more trees more grass more pokemon etc even the textures looked the way they there would better immersion overall instead get poor graphics limited world and barren empty environments all that being said this unfortunately doesn equate better performance the game still suffers from performance issues and pop aside from visuals and performance the game itself has repetitive gameplay loop there are dungeons pla real puzzles interesting caves there are pokemon and there are more pokemon and your only job throw balls them and fight them not having ivs evs breeding competitive battling held items etc removes huge aspect replay ability and purpose from the game not having any interesting nice looking environments explore puzzles and real challenges aside from making your character roll the side make this overall experience very lack luster some would probably say that only hardcore pokemon fans would like this game but disagree think there are plenty hardcore pokemon fans who simply recognize this games flaws and are able acknowledge this not the definitive edition pokemon what all wanted you like simply catching pokemon reading lots dialogue exploring empty worlds not having any real motivation purpose aside from completing checklists then you likely enjoy this game for everyone else you going disappointed would assume though that the majority the more critical gamers and pokemon fans already know this give gamefreak credit for trying something new but this not the kind pokemon experience ultimately wanted scratching the surface getting there speak but still lacking lot charm and polish given that this game has believe only been developed for roughly year what they managed achieve that time isn bad necessarily but call this aaa nintendo switch title and charge full price for disappointing again going back the visuals and limiting the explorable world small sub sets time were for performance reasons they didn achieve their goal the world bland uneventful empty barren place there are pokemon there that but after you hide bush few times dodge roll some attacks and throw few pokeballs around you literally experienced the entirety this game there story sure but somewhat irrelevant and largely just tedious and not immersive enough given the state the rest the game now maybe gamefreak will able use this tech demo starting point create future titles and maybe doing can expect hope for more polish the future but the point here that pla doesn really add all that much the pokemon franchise and the overall experience offers very lackluster and generic think part the reason pla getting much praise has due the fact that pokemon fans are literally starving for innovation coming from the remake that brilliant diamond and shining pearl makes pla look revolutionary dodge rolling and open world exploration are not new ideas 
725,interesting and good that gamefreak finally decided innovate but the world dead and looks very ugly art style the world doesn match that the characters buildings and pokemon whose bright idea was create realistic looking ground and grass with cartoon characters filled the world makes sense art direction horrible want more evidence unity free asset store water world empty nothing happens used that open world games carried with them some feeling prestige there was always something and the worlds were filled the brim with content this game the opposite and feels like student project completely empty and void any interaction variety nature you literally cannot anything 
726,the noble arcenine made hate this game how the world could they even consider this being good how suppose avoid arcenine the space tiny 
727,the exploration really bad the point unforgivable traveling through the world just not fun since hard press run button why not like other games and there are too many vehicles for the mode travelling with the ill design switching between them also the company really don know how encourage players placing good fast travel spots like there are fast travel before bosses important battles you can adjust team select items right there and try again good luck running around the world again and again with the worst experience the other hand the combat system super screwed the totally cheated like they don know how balance the difficulty for fair combat hey lets just the players let opponent throwing pokemons out once 
728,graphics are awful there excuse for having graphics player animations worse than windwaker gamecube game close but far away things look far far worse pokemon legends can battle friends this own insane removed hold items and abilities from pokemon absolutely dumbed down system getting rid ivs fine but this rediculous people standards for pokemon games are way too low don know how you can play the game and see grass and trees not display from feet away generally look worse than gamecube wii games also just popping into existence when you get close and flying animations pokemon going 2fps off the distance while looking your character run like they pooped themselves and say acceptable remember that breath the wild was made for the wii and think how that looks sure part them using the ancient engine they used for pokemon and sun moon the 3ds but they still have responsibility for making the choice use abysmal house engine 
729,had come here and rate this thought would give the game try given slight change formula and pokémon games are criminally lazy conservative repetitive rip offs good just good makes mind hurt seeing many critics aka youtubers who are afraid losing their access early copies brainwashed super fans bribed corrupt gaming media outlets rating this game highly sucks not even going focus the graphics but you think they are acceptable any way you have standards life this console that runs the witcher botw comparisons really hold merit this department the gameplay though blimey just can fathom how fans are satisfied with this janky mess gameplay like one giant wild area from terms being empty and devoid any interest except for the pokémon themselves the battles have new gimmick that barely matters completely broken the same rock paper scissors fare with crap animations the story absolute garbage surely there has point where even the young kids that seemingly seem the audience that holds this series back get sick the narratives that they trot out 2022 still have characters just stand there and wave their hands like characters from year old ps2 jrpg exposing about nonsense whilst everyone stands around awkwardly one has cared about pokémon story for decades why there soooo much talking this game can tell you why pad out and make long boss battles are lame who thought throwing infinite magic food bags was inspired choice that plus half baked dark souls roll dodging yuck you player who really really likes switching your brain off and completing pokédex can see the appeal but just soooo bad awful graphics and frame rate awful story bland repetitive gameplay didn have the pokémon label would laughed into oblivion why just why would you invest your time playing this game and not amazing games like god war disco elysium heck you kid botw mario odyssey you completed all the great games like these maybe out the park instead just anything but this junk start being sensible with your money that this franchise with much potential can actually make some strides forward 
730,don know where all the good reviews come from are the expectations already this low gameplay first off the first hours the game are great new experiences nice ideas and the whole setting great but after the first hours this game just grind everything repetitive and gets boring world the world just boring mysteries nothing really explore besides this the graphics are awful the citys are all just copy and paste and the pokemon the world are acting like robots also the game the technical level like n64 game bad animations bad rendering lets sum pokemon finally progressing but not nearly enough this game would okay for like but not full price title course some players will have fun with the game and they like just grind the same things over and over again but this game far away from being good shouldn forget that this not indie game even looks like one this game from gamefreak and its one the most profitable franchises the industry just recommend everyone wait for massive price drop have fun stay safe 
731,core gameplay loop running from one resource node the next while capturing each pokemon least half dozen times sometimes after stuffing their ass with berries first sometimes after throwing balls mud sometimes doing the same but stealthily don know who this appeals but not the zones are also void any landmarks points interest each zone just handful vaguely different biomes littered with materials gather and pokemon catch basically few different wild area zones and frankly the dlc wild areas swsh were more interesting than these different pokemon species behave like each other you got hostile pokemon that seem spot you from way further than you can even lock tho them you got skittish pokemon that run away and despawn when they spot you and you got neutral pokemon that don give but that the extent variation pokemon behavior the boss fights are ridiculously easy and the basic can get itself stuck level geometry there way you get hit the telegraphed attack patterns more than once side quests are mostly fetch quests there are literal hours worth dialogue none voice acted you probably mash through most scaling through the story bit wonky there isn much reason put effort into your team when whatever the next zone offers usually stronger and higher level anyway you could just bruteforce capture alphas and way overpowered anything you currently face battle mechanics have been heavily bastardized for this game atb turn order turn order means turns are longer taken simultaneously resulting situations where you may find yourself unfavorable matchup against much faster pokemon and you don even get the chance switch out before the enemy takes one more turns the game missing like moves and the remaining moves have been simplified fit the battle system the list missing battle features continues there are priority moves abilities held items weather control terrain hazards speed control multitarget moves and more moves that alter attack defense now affect both physical and special stat changes are now limited single stage and they only last for few turns which odd change for sure status can also now overridden another there are pvp battles but you wouldn want them with these battle mechanics anyway there are some good quality life changes like the ability swap out learned moves the instead having visit the move reminder the other hand have lost mobile access and can fast travel between zones first you must return base camp load into town leave the gates again load into the zone and then move your location because just flying directly any point interest like any other pokemon game would have been way too convenient the game pretty poor looking technical level and the artstyle inconsistent which shame the game stuck the artstyle could have looked decent soundscape also pretty barren and the sparse use background music doesn help hide pla different can respect that but also lot ways just straight worse than previous pokemon games and doesn stand its own openworld esque rpg either you want observe pokemon play snap you want battle pokemon play swsh you want open world rpg play botw pla has some aspects them all but does very poorly 
732,how you defend game this quality the pokémon franchise one the most profitable and people keep justifying game freak for this garbage glad they brought something new but the quality really poor about time everyone let them know 
733,pokemon delivers once again sub par product that feels clunky uninspired hides itself under the veil being open world but reality nothing more than series blocked entries and constant hand holding set large map hell not even possible get out the main village you hit invisible wall you have warp with the map another point change areas open world the player once again treated someone who can grasp the simplest gameplay concepts yet the menuing extremely convoluted you get interrupted constantly instructions directions and obligatory tasks perform this not game tour set rails end this saying also has the worst graphics seen the last years not even worth the previous generation nintendo console would barely acceptable for gamecube title pokemon must laughing hard have many blind dedicated fans that will buy every kind minimal effort they willing shove down their throat full price unfathomable that some people dare give this game scores don they have any standards 
734,okay pokemon offers slightly different gameplay which itself might appeal one the other however the game overrated opinion technically not just dress coat also looks ugly any year old gamecube game looks better indi games steam without lot budget have much better technique there not just one billion dollar company behind the game here but two can rate well for euros expect quality every respect okay pokemon bietet ein etwas anderes gameplay was sich vllt dem einem oder anderen auch gefallen mag allerdings wird das spiel meiner meinung nach viel hoch angepriesen ist technisch nicht nur ein frack sondern sioeht dazu auch noch hässlich aus jedes jahres altes gamecube spiel sieht besser aus indi spiele auf steam ohne viel budget haben eine viel bessere technik hier steckt nicht nur ein millardenschweres unternhmen hinter dem spiel sondern gleich zwei daher kann ich nicht gut bewerten für euro erwarte ich qualität jederlei hinsicht 
735,cool gameplay mechanics but ugly game years late technically infamous inconsistent framerate empty game repetitive and boring quests badly written scenario and the least good music from the license good want renew the license and congratulations for taking the risk but nothing going well 
736,the game might great but these graphics make puke mario looks more pleasing eyes like beta fan made game made person 
737,repetitive mechanics empty scenarios giving the feeling dead space short draw distance provoking popping and poor graphics that will undermine the overall experience cant beleive one the most profitable ips ever not able pull off mechanics revamp and move time say goodbye gamefreak 
738,just retched the battle system the worst since the early generations and nothing explained all wild pokemon that are levels lower than party will randomly take turn after turn after turn and kill before get act during battle the crafting mechanics are bad the areas are too big without convenient traversal the pokedex filling really boring and assumes you catch the same pokemon again and again and again don want catch the same pokemon again want catch new ones but stuck seeing the same pokemon over and over throw pokeballs bidoofs trying fill meter just play the mainline generation games instead you want pokemon experience the switch those are much better 
739,low effort slop from the highest grossing franchise the world plays and looks like unity asset flip 
740,after few hours the same man again and again feels like bad mobile phone game not the full price 
741,just disrespect players deal with such outdated graphics doesn know how develop game they should stick the game itself could nice spin off from the main series more focused the grinding and lore the main problem with that the open map world feels empty you can interact with anything but the small number pokemon you find along the way overall kills the immersion and make you feel bored pretty soon 
742,legends arceus pretty disappointing game the game has solid mechanics but they have lot problems and pretty likely they forgotten for next games unacceptable how the game actually limits the player simple things like swiming which human capability get that being helped pokémon for every simple task something that comes all the way from 1st gen pokémon games but this game seemed like the perfect opportunity change that making the player interact more ways with world the player making exploration and catching pokémon more enjoyable next point the pokémon battles are the same trailers hyped lot people showing new refreshing battle mechanics making look like was going more than just moving the stick and pressing the button that before seing the reality once again you are limited pretty repetitive turn based combat and once again can see why people actually defend this because that something that well has been pokémon games since the very beginning but think can speak for lot players when say would have liked see and play with different battle style graphic wise this mediocre can see why people actually say doesn matter actually say nintendo hardware fault just take look botw some pretty heavy ports like doom doom eternal the witcher seeing forests with the bare minimung account trees disappointing and affects immersion some areas look plain with almost pokémon seen until they pop out nowhere and don say this game needed ray tracing textures but said just taking botw that game looks much more solid graphics once again gamefreak reuses 3ds pokémon models those that have come all the way from and now they can justify again saying they wanted make pokémon look better because they are lacking animations the world asides from walking swimming moving the model with additional animations from the ground tree that until the pokémon disappears this game has less pokémon than sword shield and that shameful this was the perfect game add voice acting and can see why they can could save immersion make the game more enjoyable and actually help convey the emotions the characters but once again they didn making the game feel plain literally wasting somewhat decent story the game trying tell lot games even f2p games have high quality voice acting nintendo switch has shown capable more than this stuttery mess and can believe this game took all gamefreak attention making bdsp bad they are these two recent pokémon games have made see that anual releases may not the way want see decent quality again pokémon games 
743,honestly really disliked legends arceus and think just done with mainline pokémon for while aside from the technical issues that all knew would coming the game just isn fun the catching got really boring for after while the weaker mons just went and felt like chore battle everything else some point felt like why just fighting these pokémon there reason ultra great balls shouldn just able deal with this which left wondering why was bothering even engage the dex the game also horribly unbalanced with your ability catch alpha pokémon you catch one then you basically sweep till the next power then you sweep again rinse and repeat the alpha pokémon are far ahead everybody and everyone else makes the game massive breeze sure you can self inflict rules not catch them but honestly shouldn have even been option the mons offer good enough rewards defeating them they should have been uncatchable mini bosses the pokedex honestly feels like padding glad its more involved don get wrong its improvement but the option further than research level nothing more than excuse get you play the game more doesn offer anything substantial and nothing you can get going well below research level every pokémon given zone now instead simply completing the dex the player for true completion must watch magicarp use splash 100 times watch the tackle ember fire wheel and almost every other move animation dozens not hundreds times you must catch every pokémon minimum times for many more because you need catch them while they unaware you watch pokémon eat food who knows how many times beat pokémon with certain type move ton times which adds the problem seeing repeated animations and this far worse than other pokémon games because you can disable battle animations and its required beat the game the world probably the worst part the game not talking about the look although also dislike the art style but the actual play world just bad its empty there nothing each zone other than catch pokémon nothing look other than coronet nothing the world interact with that fun there should more than resource gather catch want have fun things while engaging the main game feels like parred down version what could and honestly should every zone feels the same while yes one zone swampy another cold and one the sea they feel the same explore the only reason remember differences between the zones because its fresh mind few months its going all blend together recall correctly there was pathway the first zone that went and the left might have been the 3rd and that reappeared the snowy zone not pathway going and the left the exact same pathway had the same side same slope same geometry same everything the art also looks bad don mean graphically don care how looks graphically mean the art style the game bland boring and really uninspired its clear they were trying for ancient japanese art but doesn translate the game all compared other games the swtich with more inventive art styles and other pokémon games like unite tournament the game just feels like smear brown with some green and blue mixed the fan made stuff looks better than the actual game honestly think should have looked like the end the reveal trailer that would have been fantastic the characters are all also super bland its the same issue with the zones few months they going blend together again not expecting story characters pokémon akin xenoblade but expecting something more especially since this pokémon game the most story and character driven game since gen can honestly say will remember gen characters better than these ones and its because they had distinctive designs the game did improve the mass release moves seeing the true size pokémon the overworld and evolutions think all those should stay like those also enjoyed the boss fights the main draw for was interacting with pokémon the overworld and they were fun way doing that while also showing the destructive might pokémon and showing how truly dangerous they were the final thing really enjoyed was the time the game was set learning about pokémon with everyone else and watching people are afraid because how little they understand about pokémon really fun thing experience just wish the rest the game was good that 
744,lack polish and horrible graphics don make for few minor gimmicks the game still years behind 
745,the absolute minimum review with pokemon legends arceus gamefreak has created game that the one hand loved and praised heavens and the other hand objektively critisesed bare bones but how this even possible wouldn really good game critisesed only haters without any foundational and objektive reasoning pokemon legends arceus tries and very different from your classic pokemon game the changes gameplay are refreshing and clear that gamefreak finally pushes pokemon new grounds the gameplay very different and very pleasing you can through pokeball pokemon and catch while you are already your way tree with fruits and you trough ball the tree and your pokemon collects the fruits then you have different maps where you quests like the monster hunter games this concept own very nice and can quite adicting the story also quite interesting you get know the beginning the sinnoh area where only settlers exist and cities are yet build however this where the negatives come grafics artstyle tech high and grafics are all means necessity but what gamefreak delivered here disgrace punch into the gamers face and eyes the world empty there literally are types different tree designes that where just copy pasted like map editor the textures are muddy low res edgy polygonal some designes unironically look like they copied them from n64 game trees look the god damn lava like they didn allow the designers give texture and make look like actual lava and not pumpkin soup fps are also requirement for game but somewhat stable fps like breath the wild xenoblade chronicles games monster hunter rise should the expectable especially from billion dollar company that owns the biggest and most successfull franchise all time the framerate constantly below and some areas the lags are maddening breath the wild the wiiu was smooth comparison baffles mind how reviews credit the game technically faultless pokemon and charcters from game that want you explore world full animals pokemon that want you study them and build the pokedex you could expect that they interact with each other have some kind behaviour but nothing the pokemon just stand there and from point point without reason the don yawn scratch their ears scream ech other play around eat grass fruits insects smell etc there evoli cuddling with another starly building nest they are lifeless creatures they could very well scarecrows that are mechanically moved between point and the characters this game have like gestures the head looks like robot when the look from one person another eyes don seem moved all apart from the eyelids and centuries rpg developement earning billions and billions usd pokemon has still voice acting they wouldn have anime where they could borrow actors from for their own franchsie also why the hell can fly upwards quests and progression the quests repetitive boring and uninspired like gamefreak thought way artificially increase the length the game they send you from point point talk someone just sent back point and this feels like they want you spend time with walking around between speechbubbles because they just haven thought enough content all all the game obviously rushed and needed least year not two really worth full prized aaa game from probably the most wealthy gaming company the world every other independent devstudio could have done game that looks appealing the eye implement animations pokemon and characters think actual quests and better way fill the pokedex kill catch this pokemon get the pokedexentry this game didn even try good make money because the pokemon company knew from the very beginning that will print them millions and millions lovely fresh and green usd they didn even try hide tha fact that they didn spend much money the development with good visuals like does pokemon legends arceus the result company who only want our money because they already have built their reputation with the first generations pokemon games the anime and merchandise they know that they only have one thing able make more money with pokemon the absolute minimum and even less than that 
746,this game such let down much that submit first review metacritic will say loved pokemon since red blue and even though this step the right direction not going congratulate them for innovating years too late tldr grindy not great looking handholdy fetch quest that detached from the idea you caring for the pokemon you catch the game assume the game starts score and can see how progresses shall firstly the game puts you rails for hours unskippable tutorial that starts and stops every second another cutscene and you can turn off the waypoint marker cause you know who likes exploration and figuring things out points the grind unbelievable and requires you grind grind endlessly progress between areas arbitrary grind gate instead challenge you have overcome that wasn bad enough they somehow gotten the idea that catching 1000 identical pokemon exciting and wholesome not and never will points boss battles are all the same using some weird tps system where you throw bags them and have dodge just the right time now skipping pokemon battles entirely point dialogues have non options until you choose the right option there only option don pretend like have point the world feels and looks plastic like this nintendo only developer that has access reach out botw team there excuse look this shoddy furthermore traversal the environment quickly eliminated with uncontextual fast travel and steed that rides the entire map where ever you are 1min point everything you the game fetch quest which per last point trivialized points and don get started what disgrace this was for the pokemon music 
747,the game very ugly even compared other games released the same console the pokemon animations and sound effects are poor the story and battles are boring and the tutorial too slow takes more than hour start playing there musicit looked like alpha 
748,this might the most visually displeasing game have ever played and don even care for graphics the gameplay loop also very repetitive and grindy 
749,has improvements compared swsh but overall still boring game map very empty zero fun for exploring the map this game ask you repeatedly catch pokémon which fine and tiring 
750,really really really can understand how people can give points substandard game this game looks feels sounds and plays worse than games that came out years ago may kind new start for the franchise huge fan least was but the grafics are disaster the controlls are bad there voice acting sound affects are lazy made animations are rediculously bad ore not existing please honest and compare with games like god war the last rdr2 etc they are todays points standard even compare with the level other nintendo games breath the wild mario odyssey mario galaxy luigis mansion pokemon became nintendo worst games far and this game the biggest impudence them all 
751,legends arceus just incredibly ugly addition much not ideally thought through and boring and repetitive just don know how established company like gamefreak has little attention detail just miss too many places without 
752,this rough draft what could the future the best game the series exciting for the first couple hours but after that just starts get repetitive and the dull and empty environment only hurts further the problem that the main objective catch pokémon over and over and over again the same pokémon been catching for the past two decades with some slight variations there barely anything new new this time you forced this because you must complete the pokédex pokémon battles takes back seat here there build story with pokémon gyms being absent entice you level your favorite pokémon this game basically pokémon steroids catch bunch pokémon fill your pokédex and that basically the story pokémon battles and the over world take massive downgrade this half baked sorta new entry that leaves too much desired 
753,this shell game for company that makes billion dollars year this unacceptable online battles pvp 2022 trainers gyms elite four towns just little uninteresting village graphics that are very mediocre best mostly empty biomes which lack variety and show laziness design side quests that give you incentive play them that only reward you with little items like potions candy which you can get without them hardly any npcs very little music hardly any expression the character faces what were they thinking 
754,one point for the tryas know pokémon the game full handholding the beginning who thought that sun and moon has long tutorial hasn played this after hour you can finally play without getting interrupted every seconds then you encounter the endless loop gameplay which catching catching catching these and with luck was the right exemplary you needed and you can continue the next area the game drawing after numbers and you walk from one marker the next that fun for you cool not talking about the graphics even that deserved yeah story sucks making sense they got electric lights and phones even tho plays hundreds years ago the plot stupid the gameplay boring and the graphics worse than 2005 game there you got your game never buy anything from gamefreak again 
755,this time game freak decided laugh the face everyone just like every other time but with extra selling smoke all have seen the poor graphics and all the mechanical problems the game but never expected that they would not even use single braincell think about world design the town completely blocky undetailed and ugly simple the spine the world absolute emptiness there nothing besides the main mechanic the game throwing balls entire premise hostile world and how humans started get along with pokemon thrown onto the ground and spit because lazyness can believe how its worldbuilding makes absolute nonsense while being basic and poor inside the little thing they did they did wrong formidable don give because the hud fine and captures real time aswell being able move while being battle are fun and good integration pokémon games but even this totally wasted because leaving the mechanic there and not exploring further becomes repetitive and just scourge just remembered the linear caves and the white pixels dark areas maybe should give 
756,bad graphics bad game play the game unfinished and needs much polishing are talking about game freak and pokemon the state which this game has been released just unacceptable 
757,its core singleplayer game with creatures tame and fight you explore the world ultimately complete your catalogue creatures and unite the people this game ambitious undertaking considering this coming from developer that has put content first over graphics and story their previous games the issue comes from the simple fact that doesn accomplish its own goal much wider scale game with little the general gist the game catch and collect all the pokemon region before moving the next repeat again becomes repetitve very quickly and stops being enjoyable after few hours the lack variety its creatures really kills the momentum the first few hours free roaming gives you not mention its better its own standards story the npcs seem more fleshed out than evr but the series from the very beginning has had low standard and thats what bothers the most wouldn laud developer for doing the bare minimum lesser developers every time they release new game they took step the right direction dont get wrong but veer from their own formulaic games just give barebones look what pokemon should have been when came console just drives the point home that the series has gone downward spiral for quite some time this reeks demo qhat they could capable they actually tried talking about voice acring new pokemon region actual caves and dungeons traverse landmarks see and people find and give quests this feels like prototype something truly great and until that comes cannot say like this game 
758,the actual too much for this real rate nice game but orrible graphic and aspettative about the company are higher than this result 
759,this game good paper most people say but the graphics are really lackluster not asking cutting edge graphics and ultra realism breath the wild managed have beautiful world without getting ultra realism the game repetitive and sometimes just falls flat there are too many dialogues without end and sometimes there are sounds the game there are special sound effects for birds the wind etc mean there are some but they are rare that doesn feel like world feels like draft videogame this fake openworld with only few regions the npcs feel cloned there are voiceovers the music lacks variety was expecting more from franchise that has had billions from games where they have only done minor changes the changes arceus are welcome for the most part but they need fleshed out more detailed and finished just good first draft not finished game specially for 
760,the game made the idea that has been made may fans more than years ago the graphics are worse than 20yo games 
761,really disappointed about gamefreak they make bad games since years and they doesn care they always the bare minimum and never listen players the universe has nothing natural too robotic the pokemons move erratically they wander lifeless ecology wildlife anything the devs just created map and put pokemons here and there and don even speak about the graphics 
762,this the best pokemon game have ever played first pokemon game was red and blue and see the evolution amazing 
763,sounds good has the worst graphical quality the last decade empty world with new mechanics that add absolutely nothing short the that generates the most money the industry laughing your face once again 
764,people are suckered into buying unity asset flip game marketed aaa game 
765,shocked that the developers didn continue the pokemon tradition cutting the game half and selling separately pathetic attempt making players pay more than also surprised that even their most generous moments the developers still manage more greedy than some the most greediest developers the video game industry the greedy developers are charging for game that looks like was made for mobiles doesn even have the aaa quality justify the price tag the graphics are joke the textures are garbage when look some the rock textures literally looks like was ported from game cube game that embarrassing for 2022 game the animations are garbage the running animations are cringeworthy the rain effects look laughable there nothing the open world just empty world full plants rocks and empty hills that boring explore for goodness sake why doesn this video game series still have any voice acting unbelievable that there are still games with voice acting 2022 the developers are too cheap pay for voice actors this outrageous greed makes and rockstar look like saints comparison least they put voice acting their games speaking voice acting the voice acting the animals sound like they were done the developers themselves pathetic attempt keeping the budget low for this game the physics are beyond horrible especially the water physics the story trash the combat boring and repetitive when pay expect combat system with depth and detail all the developers did this game put pretty lights during every move give players the illusion that the game fun none that fun for the soundtrack terrible there multiplayer once you beat the story there not reason touch this game again charging for game with replay value cash grab all you can trade pokemon with your friends the developers were too cheap and lazy allow have pokemon battles with our friends don recommend this game all unless you want support laziness you ever wondered what would like for cheapskate develop game here 
766,but balance the people giving ten game the best direction for pokemon believe but need some polish work the future 
767,many people are acting like this the next big step for pokemon but not this not the next generation pokemon this just some weird experimental game that adds new pokemon all new mechanics will forgotten the time the next pokemon game comes out but perhaps that for the best the new battle and capture mechanics are not fun top that the game has embarrassingly low amount pokemon even less than sword and shield the game also somehow looks worse than sword and shield like the game was made amateurs this game also the reason the gen remakes are bad gamefreak the pokemon company put all their resources into this while outsourcing bdsp some name support studio legends arceus waste everyone time and money skip this one 
768,boss battles are trash and unfair the main difficulty here jump around fast enough don like such strategy rpg 
769,game looks plays like nintendo can better than this theyre asking full price after all 
770,only good thing about this game the new mechanics for catching pokémon the world large but completely empty there reward satisfaction from exploring the new battle system makes any pokémon that doesn have high speed stat worthless the gameplay extremely repetitive and tedious requiring you grind the same task times 
771,this game absolute cash grab visually mediocre which compliment after the unpolished sword and shield entries one the worst pokemon plots seen and trying compensate with some new evolutions old and classic pokemons like quilava and rowlett time for the pokemon franchise step aside the gamefreak environment and get dev team that makes justice what the pokemon franchise could bring capable hands want play interesting and non cashgrab monster collector jrpg play shin megami tensei and get game that worth your money have unlimited mommy and daddy funds and like the pokemon franchise you you underwhelming game and disappointing entry once again but what new 
772,disappointed barely any improvement from the two previous atrocities the map barren wasteland the game infested with bugs done with this series just realised been playing this out sheer nostalgia rather spend money playing games where devs respect their fanbase 
773,they copied same house seven times for main village the game not even changing rotation this point single game developer can make better game they are just lazy and they know pokemon bias people gonna buy their game anyway 
774,extremely disappointing technically the worst have seen many years still will sell more than anyone else 
775,this game repetitive empty and innovative replacing sliced bread with unsliced bread once again pokemon fans are rewarding low effort cash grab with heaps money and praise time for the pokemon franchise catch with the generation gaming that came before the last one which they have still failed any hopes for the franchise ever catch current gaming are nonexistent remember how good botw was don forget that wiiu game that was ported switch not actual switch game six years later this the garbage pokemon comes with absolutely shameful 
776,catastrophic graphism ugly the gameplay very boring the fights are not interesting only throwing bag dust the pokemon for ten minutes really scam this game was not pokemon game the rating have been less 
777,big piece garbage this game terrible many ways battles are still turn based but with less complexity since many features like items pokemon could wear were removed the graphics are absolutely terrible the game looks like ps2 game purple shiny rocks grass sprites and the worst looking water have ever seen furthermore you can literally count pixels everywhere you the semi open world feels insanely empt accept for trees rocks and grass there nothing see almost every area quest are just comleting lists repetetive boring stuff catch bidiza catch bidiza from behind overall the game what other studios would call pre alpha not worth bucks 
778,low quality graphics for 2006 game seems play metin rendering problem purple spots around the world etc 
779,its bland ugly and boring hell the worst pokemon game history feels like bad fangame 
780,this game absolut bad one the worst games ever played graphics are trash the gameplay just awful the story joke and the balance dosen exists worst game ever played the switch hate everything about 
781,people should really stop buying supporting the pokémon game series disgusting that they throw new games with the exact same flaws the previous ones had and the poorest imaginable quality regarding graphics designs and story 
782,what ugly and repetitive game sorry the worst game open world with graphics from n64 mobil game 
783,spend least cent development the game sold huge numbers you can afford 
784,gamefreak shouldn have released open world pokémon until they are the task now understand why their reticent create full explorable pokemon world they lack the technical experience for such job would better they contract external developer joint development with let say monolithsoft while the premise the roaming pokémon world dream come true soon turns into nightmare the technical shortcomings are too glaring and take you out the experience gamefreak not known for developing graphical marvels but with game the graphical gap too evident textures are one the most poor seen switch and played lot switch games some them are beta prototype quality really bad shadows are blocky the point you can see the pixels like they would come with prerendered blobs instead and could look better draw distance abysmal you can see warping geometry few meters from your character top that the memory management awful not allowing keep memory far objects that pops out nowhere draw distance for objects npc grass trees landscapes are all terrible when compared game like xenoblade chronicles you will only end with deep sadness really wanted like this game but technically below deficient and can for the life mine immerse the game without thinking how good would hands more capable developer 
785,grind grind grind grind boring quests bad graphics very bad animations hope gamefreak sees this game mistake 
786,have played every pokemon game that exists but cannot support this title gamefreak any longer despite being crazy profitable franchise once again hires random 8th grader write not new story full contradictions incorrect lore and just awful dialogue despite being wildly profitable and huge game developer once again spends resources time graphics piecing together bare bones world patched together with meshes from microsoft paint and copy pasted features with little detail the concept awesome and the potential here really high and good but themselves spend little effort developing good games and instead just throw out garbage wrapped nice pokemon wrapping paper and people buy because the franchise power this honestly insulting people who play video games and offensive sell for looks like was made someone who has experience coding artwork story writing and greenlit greedy executive just looking for paycheck 
787,its soo ugly this game somtimes look like psx game its 2022 this game look like 1999 game dont buy 
788,just finished the game this mayor disaster that never could tolerate big company like game freak and nintendo shame 
789,game awful cash grab imagine giving game that drops under fps often passing grade this game worse looking than some n64 games 
790,gameplay more repetitive than previous games npc don even have voice acting making cutscenes and conversations boring npc grunts etc wild pokemons are just walking mindlessly with simple routines making the game feels more lifeless for example monster hunter stories and you can see monsters sleeping eating and stories some monsters like velocipreys are going out hunting preys and was 3ds game graphics are horrendous game where the time you were walking out the world least make the world looks decent was worse than 3ds game character models are total downgrade from sword and shield like how imagine visual artists working another game trying make their game looks pleasing possible only for pokemon tarts say they work doesn matter because grapichs aren everything don say that pokemon need ultra realistic visuals all saying least make looking better than fecking wii games biggest offender this game the animations monster hunter stories and smt are proof that monster collecting game can have good animations unsurprisingly pokemon continue trends make sub par animations that feel robotic and unnatural just try compare mhst animations pla tldr offensive opinion game made developers played nostalgia blinded fans who never play any other game than pokemon 
791,game made without love the gameplay fun sometimes technically shame not even low graphics game badly done with poor technical decisions 
792,this game has inexcusable graphics looks like they pulled the blocky graphics from the original roller coaster tycoon game have seen better graphics gamecube looks soooooo bad have concluded the devolpers have graphical talent 
793,too big for gamefreak there are some good ideas here and there but very poorly executed graphics destroy and limit the whole experience disaster beta version what should 
794,the graphics are unbelievable bad you asking yourself why this game gets golden showered with and the sign the times sign the world turning 
795,between textures running 240p horrible white artifact pop whenever the game gets dark bad draw distances and pop and distant pokemon often running 2fps this game visually embarrassing the battles aren cooler different you can just move your character during them which purely cosmetic sometimes you get 1v2 1v3 battles even against trainers but you cant send out another mon and theytook out aoe attacks this feels like f2p mmo from the early 2000s minus all the other people 
796,game and creation saga big pokémon that moves millions great shame half done graphics half done animations hours tutorial technical and artistic non existent open world gamefreak has done again and mediocre game will once again sell lot fandom without criteria 
797,understand that game freak does not own all the money that the pokémon trademark makes also understand that nintendo does not have say how game freak make their games but still understand that breath the wild was released four years ago and looks better than arceus the hardware isnt the problem the very game that arceus trying copy for its mechanics and open world four years older and yet somehow looks better plays better more story more heart more everything and bucks for this desaster from game freak year after year have stop this 
798,the real problem this game not the graphics which however problem but the problem lies the very foundations the game passing off primary missions the obvious fetch quests collectible classics any other game pure shame absolutely absent plot dialogues without minimum logic all all 
799,absolutely embarrassing both technically and gameplay level there may absolutely some player who can like but this game didn have the name pokemon would blasted away with lot 
800,far worst pokemon game have ever played people complained about sword and shield and now praise this completly discusting 
801,think safe say that the pokemon games fan base has become cult sorts this point realising game this state and getting praise downright disgusting dont get scammed for this game this beta test for what could somenthing way more polished dont get surprised takes another years for something actually worth while get release thant you pokemon fan base 
802,feels like step the right direction and appreciate the idea change the formula but god what disaster rushed game repetetive mediorce gameplay embarassing visuals with saving grace all the positive reviews have paid off one their right mind could possibly enjoy this game feels like tech demo from 2003 not complete game 
803,very poor game pokemon legends arceus breaks the traditional pokemon formula that all know and love the game feels very empty with almost extra content big disappointment overall 
804,the graphics are sh1tthe rest would good legends arceus just game without its franchise would definitely mediocre collect thon with some qol elements serviceable plot subpar graphics and musical score which while charming bit too subtle the overworld the fact that has full game price tag would definitely turn some people away 
805,this not open world nor new attempt many pokemon fans are trying overestimate the game saying has made new attempt for pokemon but can give high scores these games just because pokemon comes out 
806,huge pokemon fan here opinion this game one the worst pokemon games all time like the fact that they finally tried out something new but game freak has failed the music lame and boring the graphics are from 2004 botw from 2015 and looks thousand times better the world empty and very generic some places are just copy pasted 
807,best pokemon ever without any doubts beautiful graphics almost made cry the open world looks full life incredible detailed textures made with love lots pokemon having interesting interactions between them story and mechanics are the best the franchise far many things catch the same pokemon again again and again and craft many love put into the animations very cheap game only etc must buy other pokemon game achieves this perfection 
808,the only way you can like this game you have never played another open world game there are hundred better open world games with infinitely less budget 
809,don recommend anyone all nice ideas renew the brand but none done well 
810,tragic graphics janky gameplay poor story boring repetitive quests awful effort open world game 
811,disappointment brings nothing new the open world formula you much better off with breathe the wild shameless cash grab gamefreak cant make pokemon game extreme hand holding and too many filler cutscenes nickname for pokemon fetch quest 
812,this may the most disappointing pokemon game ever the graphics suck the entire overworld feels empty towns cities gyms elite champion extra content like contests secret bases anything similar very very few trainer battles don know what they were thinking 
813,basic and worse copy attack titan mixed with monster hunters game should free play with these graphics and this story telling monster hunters but cost euro and way less fun worse graphics and entertaining mechanics please save your money and download fan made version pokemon those actually have some story and fun 
814,very disappointed this game this was the first game bought release day over years and was really excited about for months ahead time after about hours put the game away and have real desire pick again super repetitive and doesn even feel like pokémon game had total battles against other trainers most and they all had like pokémon each pokémon has always been about creating good team leveling them and battling against others without the battling aspect feel like there point the game don even remember what pokémon have party because not even creating battle team just hold them and complete various research tasks level them evolve complete more research tasks and then cycle through other pokémon shame because this game introduced some wonderful battle mechanics like strong agile moves the ability switch out your move set outside battles and then takes battles away and makes this game all about catching pokémon might well pokémon snap very disappointed spent money this game was already getting nervous because the time period and being told there are gyms pokémon league but didn think they would eliminate the core what pokémon game and that creating team and battling against other teams should have waited and passed this probably won even finish this only reason might because hate leaving games unfinished but frankly time way better spent with bdsp until gen comes out 
815,long the developer doesn suffer huge sales failure they will continue develop mediocre games not support game freak pokémon fans deserve more 
816,the same disappointment every year very low quality and ugly graphics repetitive gameplay the same always 
817,technically ps2 game also flat world that doesn have soul pokémon are png that walk completely random and also doesn interact with them they are strage habitats like hauter the snow habitat other stupid things probably game freak should get helped because this game completely garbage 
818,not gonna lie this pokémon game looks really bad the graphics are horrible but over looked all that because this the most fun had playing pokémon game while this amazing step the right direction and the story pretty interesting far its something different longer old going the same journey teenager who new world the best story but then again wasn expecting naughty dog story telling levels honestly wasn even expecting into the story all the last pokémon games followed the story with were and and black and white look the reviews for few past pokémon games sword and shield brilliant diamond and shining pearl this has been the best reviewed pokémon game long time there are plenty new surprises this game and wont spoil anything you don care about graphics all then this pokémon game for you other than the weak weak weak graphics this pokémon game easy need stop trying make excuses for game freak this company makes too much money put out games that look like launch ps3 game breath the wild splatoon mario odyssey metroid new pokémon snap and pokken can look amazing switch can future pokémon games maybe don need new pokémon game every year would cool waiting while for another game means more polished better looking experience also telling game freak isnt good with making games isnt excuse hire talent that good making games pokemon billion dollar other than gripes with the graphics its fun pokémon game the most fun had years from pokemon game finding new things and seeing new evolutions for exciting 
819,despite having good ideas and being the first innovative pokemon game the last years its graphics the least its problems this game insult the player treats had years old the dialogues are pathetic and despite having very simple and very easy understand has more that tutorials without letting explore the world anything freely just hope next pokemon games will something least acceptable with the core ideas this game 
820,plays like over price mobile game not very many pokemon and less battles even sword and shield better all they did was recycle old pokemon into game supposed research them like there something new the game significantly shorter then any the other pokemon games 
821,doesn have squirtle how can pokemon game launched without simply having the best pokemon the game this disrespectful 
822,but balance with people giving fun game but boring after few hours bad graphics and boring music 
823,great idea executed poorly with many other gorgeous games avaliable the switch stands reason game gamefreak should look least similar instead barely hides its stuttering fps issues and subpar graphics with the collecting pokemon its had throughout its series the new gameplay stunted the glaring issues the game has its foundation the fundamental flaw lack variety when all said and done there replayability this game after finishing the pokedex there multiplayer battles rebattling trainers new pokemon after completing the regional dex breeding mechanics and other goals left ehat you have left barren world rife with monsters youve already have caught over and over which brings back the flaw lack variety measly 242 pokemon catch with the small amount actual battles you get experience reduces your options for actually using your pokemon only few instances you will seeing your mounts more than you will ever see your own pokemon battle another aspect that find irritating the amount design taken straight from breath the wild from its menu options its game hud ends emulating much better game remind you you could playing that instead tries hard something wasn begin with and then trips over itself presentation 
824,worst pokemon game ive ever played its catching simulator with barely any battles graphics horrible fps issues and rendering assets the game from barely feet away from seen playstation games with better graphics and hardware not the problem look botw and xenoblade and monster hunter the switch way better and the same system lazy devs milking the pokemon name for money they dont even have online pokemon battles barely any battling the game all frank 
825,you like catching pokemons this your game but you like fighting just don buy this game 
826,lamentable que una las franquicias que más dinero genera saque venta juego así inadmisible que solo por ser pokémon haya que conformarse con juego mediocre que aporta nada más allá estilo juego monster hunter que realmente mundo abierto están inventando nada que haya sacrificando apartado gráfico lleno popping bugs que peor que wii apartado sonoro repetitivo inexistente algunos casos historia flojita con unos diálogos que llevan ninguna parte puesto que elección del diálogo una falsa ilusión con personajes inexpresivos sin gancho juego con poca dificultad mucho texto cuyo mundo abierto resulta vacío con pueblo lleno casas copiadas pegadas innovación sistema juego está bien pero sacrificando todo demás juego disfrutable camino que van seguir los próximos juegos pokémon estará bien siempre cuando repitan los errores este gráficos diálogo dificultad etc éxito solo porque los fans pokémon nos conformamos con cualquier basura debería ser así desde punto vista consumidor deberíamos exigir más unfortunate that one the franchises that generates the most money releases such game inadmissible that just because pokémon you have settle for mediocre game that does not contribute anything beyond monster hunter style game which not really open world and they are not inventing anything that does not already exist sacrificing section graphic full popping bugs and what worse than the wii repetitive and non existent sound section some cases the weak story with dialogues that lead nowhere since the choice dialogue false illusion with inexpressive characters and without hook game with little difficulty and lot text whose open world empty with town full copied and pasted houses the innovation the game system fine but not sacrificing everything else the game enjoyable and the path that the next pokémon games are going follow will fine long they not repeat the errors this one graphics dialogue difficulty etc success only because pokémon fans settle for any garbage and shouldn like that from the point view the consumer should demand more 
827,always trying make something completely different and sell the name they put let break down you change everything about something can you still call the same thing let say artificially produce orange when you see looks like orange but you begin peel you notice that green the inside and instead being juicy and squishy crisp like apple and taste like jalapeno you assumed was orange the surface without delving deeper and creating opinion now ask how many you would still call this monstrosity orange because certainly would not this has been the same scenario with most switch games you people are skiddish say you dislike something today society you just not prone thinking for yourself and let the media and other outside information strongly influence your opinion 
828,battles are boring and the exploration very lackluster clearly nintendo had shipped out here and going the second version that would probably worth playing 
829,graphics are unbelievable bad and the gameplay repedetive you just running from quest marker top quest marker 
830,terrible game visuals are horrible the world barren and dry people only say this game good because step forward but game freak can put the effort make good game there point buying any future pokémon game until they they know that anything with pokémon the title will sell trust really wanted like this game but with all these issues and bugs cannot have game released 2022 look worse than games released launch with switch cannot support game that looks like the world has been through nuclear winters 
831,this game have bad graphics bad design boring grind fest loop this embarrassing for the most popular franchise the world what the point growing pokémon there aren any trainers grind fest ugly environment music voice acting story the best lava and water graphics ever almost better than sea thieves gamefreak made money grab 
832,quite the different pokemon game from the main line series however this one the best pokemon gaming experiences ever had 100 would recommend fans the franchise 
833,final boss too cheap that not fail all not beyond type insulting 
834,boss fights aren thought out properly too many bugs and sloppy development 
835,not open world and kinda boring graphics are pretty bad the beginning the game has ton dialog
