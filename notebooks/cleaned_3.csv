495,nice games really love new gameplay mechanics graphics really good fine 
496,great amazing time playing mechanics kept entertained whole perfect needs polish parts still highly recommend 
497,breath wild meets bit monster hunter mixed love closest open world daydreamed since kid arceus delivers snap levels environmental immersion mainline rpg encounter walking swimming flying around natural habitats instead randomly encountering something blindly walking tall grass summon gather berries mine shards engage wild within steps without waiting flow stopping animations transitions truly like playing simulation anime issues bothersome might fact fast travel back hub city order next zone like monster hunter makes world feel lot smaller since bunch disconnected environments instead huge continent also mounts hub city makes traveling drag minor issues sound effects clearly ripped botw male character sounding exactly like link tucks rolls maybe meant callback personally wish didn recycle assets like graphics also little rough around edges things like rocks trees disappear slightly turn camera sometimes draws max spawn distance animates like fps makes look bizarre smooth lively world closer hardware struggling draw far anyways give rough around edges parts definitely formula want polish perfect think able stomach old style games nintendo somehow cram modern setting centers cities etc open world walking onto little switch cartridge absolutely perfect may possible switch may horsepower truly get next level though 
498,despite world fully open nothing wrong botw fully open better drawing distances draw distance terrible legends arceus best played long time since gen tons content used sadly nothing compared rpgs like skyrim story fairly long didn rush took around hours would like see jhoto access kanto region full national dex modern jhoto ancient jhoto regular gen jhoto couple cities multiple towns huge routes catch still playing haven fully captured legendaries hours already finished main story post story missing secondary missions story meh decent forgot talk yeah nothing special compared mystery dungeon better recent games tho 
499,pokémon fan late 1990s honestly say pokémon legends arceus well worth time play well yes people might turned away art style freak chose gonna judge personally art style looks pretty good pokémon looks great world looks vast open give criticism say brought voice acting including pikachu eevee voice actors really like giving pokémon legends arceus everything wanted pokémon yes surpassed expectations held back voice acting hopefully freak decides fix sometime future

502,graphics leave lot desired pokémon legends arceus gameplay retooled much smooth engaging experience moving away traditional rpg format feels like modern open world akin breath wild feel represents significant leap pokémon whole drawing closer pokémon always dreamed without graphical issues however aren significant enough hamper gameplay overall would certainly recommend looking open world pokémon experience things like open world catching battling pokémon fly battles occur environment arenasthings like unfinished feeling graphics low quality textures aggressive pop star progression feel like grind times

523,simultaneously best embarassing thing gamefreak ever released fantastic bundled obviously underdeveloped package pokémon models animations look great world looks like early progress shot would see indie dev share twitter laughable bad looks areas especially caves dark areas background literally warp around character like poorly greenscreened many gripes story pacing lot dialogue scenes either need cut shorter interesting voice acting would helped otherwise honestly fantastic favourite pokémon experience date wish came like year later would development time needed would love style continue iterated major improvement old formula like settlememts explore complex side quests etc would dream also thank god released one version 
524,necessary experiment pokémon franchise executed fairly well importantly think laid solid foundation future sequels build formula focuses entirely single player experience differs games series battling human players minimal interaction others entirely design serves prequel pokémon franchise areas explore empty due underdeveloped definitely gives series long desired sense exploration adventure huge fan pokémon games played several skipped others wasn mood formula changed years welcome change pace still keeping core spirit pokémon universe gameplay loop feels much like early pokémon main objective explore catch pokémon pleasant explore however gameplay loop get little repetitive found taking lot breaks would regularly return breath wild atmosphere relaxing minimal music wild ambient nature noises music soft piano vast open spaces also appreciate added substance story granted nothing crazy provides welcome change pace beat gym leaders get badges become best provided past years graphics aren bad people make definitely aren impressive almost feel like weren able high quality graphics whether cartoon realistic would looked better degree artistic design maybe watercolor impressions anything really graphics damper sense exploration little bit overall fun see taking time play relaxing experience everything solid effort exceptional laid groundwork future sequels truly fantastic games definitely tell far exciting possible new generation pokémon could introduce probably one memorable pokémon experiences last years

542,graphics good terms landscape basic gets nowadays necessarily bad subpar seen lowered framerate pokémon get get certain distance terms actual gameplay though really enjoyed core loop finding pokémon different task order get research point enjoyable sort get lost exploring finding pokémon find one corners area probably still missed things way despite graphics fun casual play could easily see someone playing long train ride car trip sort want portable system 
543,finally solid entry franchise stagnating last half decade generous swsh easily least favorite pkmn time bdsp extremely pointless retread old little way anything new compelling offer extremely skeptical pretty convinced would end mess curiosity ended getting better really say pretty thoroughly won ultimately comes gameplay actually quite compelling time around comes fact actually requires thought part player terribly difficult unforgiving anything isn mindlessly easy either might actually need think type match ups moves teach might even bit planning resource management strategy play imagine huh anyway real massive complaints quite fun mindless check bunch things list sort way even though definitely big shortcoming visuals never cared much graphics unfortunately say looks awful gamefreak needs staff visual department isn actively detrimental opinion definitely going people others aware 
544,hours look forward quite disappointed first hours minus opening dialogue gave goosebumps saw baked pokémon sprites fluctuating quality depending standing complete zelda botw rip less charm however get past slow start inconsistent graphics starts pick team gets stronger able less likely get destroyed wild backtrack see missed previously get used mechanics know navigate around actually pretty fun plenty side quests actually bit annoying overwhelming see trillion people asking things village bit want say moments really beautiful theme piano music starting undetected grass throw pokeball kadabra lol also combat pretty good quite visually appealing although bit derpy run middle battle anyways things considered definitely grown actually bit addictiveanyways quick review would say take opinion try make mind 
545,obvious developed enough one would like opinion good start new vision franchise capture realistic world see whole surface also need loading screens hope next installments seek use formula improve notably since obviously limps lot graphics feeling living world 
546,visuals graphic really bad always pokèmon right blame gamefreak main storyline bit lame doable get used graphic style especially first zone pokémon flying fps distance start get captured really enjoy fresh innovations new type gameplay 
547,one best pokémon since beginning long time since fun capturing pokémon seeing new one exploring map graphic wise could better since first open world hope future continue make like one upgrade graphic 
548,playing pokémon since platinum quite bit burn last couple games legends hold many ask let get big downside done first lack art direction personally mind lower graphics whole experience could stylized like mhst2 picked recently play nino kuni pretty old came playstation switch holds art direction second issue mostly abilities held items pokémon help differentiate pokémon battle like layers complexity specially turn based jrpgs past bad first say fun ever catching pokémon allows engage different ways stealth first option method choice getting bonus throwing ball back satisfying take pokémon head battle want pokémon run early run start battle back throwing pokémon behind fun stun filling dex thought gonna tedious fun gotta engage different aspects catch level research level said pokémon give berries find ones different weight size evolve defeat battle see perform moves also yes count use battle stealth catching also add research levels also exploring open zones finding pokémon great specially find rare encounter didn see first time going area pro tip heavy balls early friend gotta get close worth specially catching alpha pokémon give seed mastery use master move back town use heavy agile style said move great exp team good chunk money finally money need upgrading inventory size onto story characters without spoilers pretty good specially pokémon standards usual pokémon visually striking characters great personalities bad voice acting feels like next step pokémon tendency speed read without voice acting kinda forget little said fact overall think story probably best seen pokémon black white conclusion believe great ways engage catching filling pokédex technical limitations show heavily pokémon full life personality animated hopefully future kind games allowed time bake oven solid art direction story characters great still voice acting feels like would wonderfully series like adding charming characters overall continue formula older audiences win 
549,huge step foreward semi open world huge improvement graphics could better lack trainer battles one point critical even thought explained story therefore 10other positive improved fighting systems elite crafting need trading real people get like gengar pokedex system lot potential upcoming gamesnegative graphics outdated 2022 lack trainer battle 
550,perfect far mainly graphics greatest point disappointment would taken little longer polish alas look however since think best funniest pokémon since nintendo days also first long time truly play hours end day day hatching plan sneak strong pokémon really want fight still catch seeing plan work best thing ever even fail still something learn failure apply next time wild pokémon also feel stronger games huge plus makes really think team gonna bring going wild tltr even though perfect still fun super refreshing pokémon franchise excited see next

570,great new direction franchise fantastic world building lore expansion fresh battle mechanics make best decade let graphics somewhat grindy aspects 
571,preview future games look like gameplay great pokedex quest quite entertaining lacking basics example breeding abilitys special evolution mega zstones dinamax though liked graphic elements grassstalks attacks overall graphics garbage diffuculty unexpected high continuously underleveld trouble travel areas without resting trainer battles easy level dependent abilitys items could improve difficulty really hope continue evolving series direction maybe even bigger scope better graphics 
572,prefect graphical issues lack voice actingbut around refreshing change gameplay gamefreak made good pokémon since gen 
573,great freak really good job trying new things thing miserable graphics

575,100gameplay barebone everything already satisfying going around throwing pokéballs 
576,untertaning pokémon played years yes graphics kinda ugly visual glitches time time really anecdotic playing soundtrack sweet mix nostalgia modernity sound design awesome gameplay innovative get little spicy especially postgamei would recommend pokémon

578,summary classic pokèmon would preferred open world open map graphics maybe better level unity crap however leveling system strange throughout story also equal level towards end required team leveled well call unbalancing good sincerely hope games series improve starting negative points knowing gamefreak 
579,fun pokémon played years new gameplay mix stealth combat polished progression lock behind star rank given motivation catch pokedex research pokedex research simple easy come done many pokémon catch many beaten battle type moves beat pokémon biggest complaint engine used think one freak used sword sheild textures pop slow pop pokémon get annoying texture glitch battles wild pokémon randomly clip thought rock tress making uncatchable graphic aren good freak never work

581,promising evolution series hope direction series absolutely addicted gameplay loop navigating open area different requirements needed pokedex entry highly recommend fan 
582,god world envrionment ugly gameplay really good though would say able look pass story lack multiplayer battle system gym battles horrendously bland lifeless world hisui alright pick company big freak feels kinda lazy 
583,completed 20hours extremely boring story gyms leagues easily exploited gameplay allowed catch everything single ball aggro graphic old looks like ps2 era idea people rate higher sword sheild half baked add ability throw ball nothing new 
584,legends arceus without franchise would definitely mediocre collect thon qol elements serviceable plot subpar graphics musical score charming bit subtle overworld fact full price tag would definitely turn people away said pokémon pretty damn good great good new focus old catch motto turned better best way describe address deals complaints previous entries received old gyms championship exploration world capturing pokémon serve goal posts progress trade evolutions gone item animations models art style world worse expressive remember bdsp swsh many cutscenes dialogue boxes plot point catch quests advance kept long point level capture block gone worry though catching strong pokémon going suddenly break one thing still restricted level limits pokémon obeying catch one league listen much experience still exp share distributed better sparingly catch level rapidash starting area due fluke get levels say pretty balanced grinding sucks focus catching exp going come sneak throw long battles necessary except certain cases battle battles suck gave one hell boost opponents abuse special mechanics use strength level differences pronounced play smart since combat isn single turn switches anymore listen wanted pokémon would erase past controversial entries fun many people rightfully think could done sooner better still help really enjoy maybe one time thing sincerely hope fun sign gamefreak going right direction development

599,love think one best absolute best pokémon games ever made also think contender goty true achievement series scoring seemed stop working point accepted narrative story loosely makes sense interesting captures imagination everyone newest trainer hardened veteran parts doesn seem far enough boss fight feels repetitive real mechanical changes present monster fighting parts narrative genuinely tug heartstrings make player feel real world people care also initial scene waking beach completely different time era basically mention trying get home understand point fact catch pokémon even point collection research something mentioned along learn closer figuring might able get home would dynamic feels little lazy like couldn find way start story coming back time gameplay really gameplay incredible pokémon feel like making incredible creatures fight reason instead catch pokémon guise research release regular part truly amazing step series every throw pokeball feels great time craft something masse get little shot serotonin knowing made pokeballs however reason never explained narratively visually appear completely unable climb even simplest hill swim reason reason hinderances player obvious want access areas early pokémon stronger least make visually narratively interesting make hill steep climbing gear maybe raining simply slippery climb swim pokémon attack maybe character know swim least give reason road blocks proudly calls open world final thoughts tremendous step forward series adds new breath something hasn truly experienced new ness feels like two decades hope take side series new area future well whether means ancient hoenn region perhaps ancient alola anywhere kanto also hope whatever next main series borrows least innovation gameplay pokémon seen less competitive tools like subjects research proports 
600,legends arceus bold new step nintendo gamefreak would outstanding several years ago pla great job making feel like truly exist world good job immersing player new mechanics presents catching new dynamic ever choose old route start battle weaken enemy attempt catch utilize open world items disposal distract feed even stun simply throw ball even possible use method catch alpha unaware capture without need battle new crafting system well quite simplistic get job done found going wild simply gather materials crafting action reward basic good job also goes solid job offering newer powerful items progress make seem like actually improving member survey corps story wise expect solid enough keeps attention part nothing remarkable wow moment story moments elicit much emotional response towards end skipping dialogue wanted play battles largely ability run around interesting first couple battles forgot even could stopped altogether real reason move around outside seeing different angles randomly target player character battle long stand directly fighting safe harm status conditions get updated felt long overdue bad looks terrible runs terribly unacceptably awful full fledged console 2022 jagged edges frame pacing models popping existence several graphical glitches plague severely hurt score either time gamefreak find new engine nintendo find new developer cut clear like art style tried could aesthetically pleasing appearance isn ugly poorly optimized retail price reflect amount polish put disappointing presentation switch greatly enjoyed experience likely playthrough several times know world hyperbole dramatics seems like low score fantastic step right direction ball court improve upon 
601,definitely fresh take repetitive formula main focus collecting better pretty much series however also times feels like play testing upcoming title one graphics look like something years ago furthermore main plot could improved voice acting however many vital features like breeding online battles completely missing 
602,huge step dreamt years really could used another year dev time add polish feel company crushingly strict yearly release schedule stifle potential fun ever ignoring 
603,good yes major flaws definitely step right direction pokémon 
604,extremely fun enjoyable waiting made takes elements open world games adds universe combat extremely slick seems almost fresh old gamers one thing wish built upon visuals although legends arceus fun entertaining lacks visual department doesn mean good overall 
605,new pokémon buying graphics fill first ever pokédex find various types pokémon 
606,generally going right direction let sword shield brought aspect freak denied avid players years system legends arceus terms battle capture unquestionably superior every preceding death battle screen satisfying say least world interaction great addition issue better looking battles far many trainers gyms storyline induced building towns settlements upon completion led trainers first ever gyms would 1000 effective certainly succeeded putting old tired mechanics rest failed foregoing aspect competition hope arceus remedy way dlc hopefully much expansive dlc saw sword shield certainly better direction catching battle exploration aspect franchise 
607,besides hirribal graphics physics great gameplay wise side quest bit repetetive 
608,tldr flawed good experience core something gamefreaks execution pretty disappointing still enjoy playing emerald really need perfect graphics think graphics pretty laughable done overall world design feels empty textures exploring world fun catching also fun hopefully let someone else take making games future like like 
609,fun entire battling aspect games essentially put back burner forgotten nearly enough opportunity use team assemble love new mechanics open world aspect graphics rather poor 
610,best beta ever played best way summarize world lacks depth feels empty graphics could easily improved difficulty low even real fights end option chose difficult mode want play longer years old longer want play versus trainer pokemons playing hours also much pointless dialogues 
611,shakeup franchise desperately needed ultimately flawed execution play great story much found getting story without caring much anything anyone catching different unique ways fantastic strong agile style feel like need time oven performance unacceptable looks poor feels needed time reach excellence happy everyone enjoying time though however feel disingenuous give glaring issues 
612,standards games time low legends arceus means bad continues trend barebones feels immediately outdated franchise doesn seem grow backwards step maybe reduction formula set new foundation later games bit late world isn enjoyment traverse hindered visually underwhelming lacks sense activity exist player interact world meaningful way collectibles past wasn big problem creating team conquer league always goal real goal yet linger mostly aggressive timid creatures really displaying much nature showing character maybe thinking expect much yes expect lot one successful franchises lifetime considering titles franchise features would suitable trend games lose features gain yet one well received games franchise seems good enough step right direction absolutely good sure vacuum games may one best opinion better call entitled supported franchise since first iteration think fanbase deserves much higher quality leaves position want support good parts franchise hopes get better versions excitement initial highly positive reaction getting something isn disappointment means quality quite low enough company wants make money okay bad great honeymoon period wears back state disappointment wait something truly good 
613,completed 100 last night always recommend franchise fans without many criticisms changes play completely many long awaited new mechanics hope stay future games still major improvement past games especially recent bdsp remakes unfortunately technical aspects title lacking may lower enjoyment experience lot sad know avatar exploring forest name appearing top corner visual environment unsatisfying many places similar one another inside map art direction great always immersion ruined lacking knew lacking trailer would still granted another disturbing aspect writing new low pokémon always childish writing instance every dialog contradicts one time pokémon feared village population well established region already pokéride living peacefully pokémon told one knows capture pokémon explain told greater battler teacher way skilled told pokémon fearsome shown character knowing many species peaceful toward easy catch live know mostly children would love contradicting often combat mechanics improvement need fixing especially battling trainers build like slow team might occur one member next one entering wait moves opponent resulting another without able anything late rethink team one trainer attacked times row demolishing team rise difficulty design flaw since might want play favorite pokémon without disadvantage slower pokémon fill penalized good one play loop enjoyable keep working optimizations skills fix problem could new starting point brand 
614,really enjoy playing cool players ever wanted one voice needs anti aliasing playing docked3 need character animations choices like pressing stone button instead chat selections need better way track side quests track progressionsometimes feel dev team lazy decisions aspects end good refresh franchise expect next games like online coop battle arenas 
615,finally franchise old classic gamestyle compared jrpg nothing looks increadible charm strong technical point view pla looks like 2002 worst art direction 
616,played hours legends arceus good lot could done better absolutely things expanded upon yes step right direction though certainly gameplay arguably important aspect happy say legends arceus provided strangely satisfying looking trailers may concerned environments nothing really explore somewhat true terrain bit dull times also times find wandering hidden corner map rewarded various things even terrain isn interesting find items pick make comes requests bit mixed really interesting slightly comedic almost anime fashion wield cool rewards others however leave looking complete phone due boring scavenger hunt mind look stuff think hints would narrow search would made experience lot better battles noble surprisingly difficult consistent difficulty curve one issues cobalt coastlands mostly arena makes feel like fluffing way finally manage somehow beat still fun could better one alabaster icelands favorite hard fun type hard trainer battles lack better description interesting beginning story basic comparable sword shield battling time get post though leans towards almost unfair territory expect cynthia platinum arguably beyond battling changed lot feelings bit mixed one side adds bit strategy appreciated side seem bit unfair annoying especially speed right gate new status effects actually pretty cool wouldn mind implemented generation crafting also nice touch surprisingly well balanced overall give gameplay story fairly average get post lot feels like could gone deeper explained less presses button think two things freak learn future show rather tell repeat single point several times better sword shield still needs work last plot point post definitely worth though story expect best legend arceus graphics animation terrain far away look downright ugly properly portray actually instance look heartwood heights base camp almost trees nonexistent anti aliasing also really weird times especially around water animations department actually bit better comparison isn quite monster hunter levels animations good enough keep immersed times mostly requests somewhat obvious took shortcuts nowhere near bad sword shield graphics animations music one legends arceus high points blissful heartwood traverse lands night music brings sometimes want battle hear tracks without interruption two tracks play cobalt coastlands takes mood though cobalt coastlands cobalt coastlands version references diamond pearl route 210 track fits diamond pearl tracks doesn really fit feel get cobalt coastlands nice chill day beach pinch danger music sprint adventure ahead sort feel also times felt battle wild pokémon track got bit repetitive maybe slight variations depending would made lot better also one trainer battle wish dramatic music instead normal trainer theme nit picks though didn way enjoyment much overall hope generation future legends titles improve upon make something truly great promise 
617,although good one compared bdsp understand people call played around hours say thing makes enjoyable mechanics story solid best graphics truly horrific fan old games dont care graphics visual bugs disappearing assets truly bad shame botw manage graphics way better switch rather 
618,probably know good already ahead list negatives impacted overall impression subpar graphics breath wild looked way better back released five years ago low framerate best often far camera constantly shifting way make stay place empty world aside pokémon wandering around farming points nothing else find anywhere trainers points interest treasure chests etc switch pokémon inbetween turns battle story npcs wild pokémon fight using several pokémon stuck using single one even battles isn uncommon unless fine wasting precious money buy poké balls craft turn means end farm resources little tedious actually add complete entry pokémon pokédex need fulfill som criteria like catching certain number pokémon defeating certain number pokémon might seem like fun addition paper forced less tasks every single pokémon gets annoying pretty quickly flying mount isn actually flying rather gliding making borderline useless travel unless start high plateau clunky controls riding mount even close enough enemy focus doesn mean poké ball reach often inches alerting pokémon presence potentially make turn aggressive lot pokémon long aggro range making impossible approach unless sneak behind sneaking extremely slow pokémon approaching likely turned around noticed time close enough actually hit ball hiding grass throw poké ball fails catch pokémon noticed probably attacked pokémon even still hidden impossible find boss fights frenzied yellow pokémon godawful dodge mechanic clunky best window opportunity sending pokémon fight boss injured enough frustratingly narrow unless basically second message pops screen poké ball bounce boss recover means usually stuck slowly whittling away boss entire throwable items 
619,okay first hate hand holding start fun pretty worth full price art 
620,new mechanics direction installment moves franchise enjoyable however seems unfinished missions repetitive visual section gets way enjoyment delivery value enjoyable changes introduces weighed constants sloppiness visual section development missions narratives simplistic repetitive 
621,changing review put score first first hours tutorial terrible like everyone like years old improves technically course terrible related gameplay fun bad nothing revolutionary maybe franchise yes gaming general nothing games many years ago better fan franchise enjoy average 
622,pokémon slowly turning cheap jrpg graphics shockingly bad poor frame rate tutorial lasts hour rushing dialogue interrupts constantly playing force bland generic npc cutscenes forgettable characters nothing interest say world barren little atmosphere nothing worth exploring people excuse deserve mess update stick hours lets training wheels start fun still great 
623,new pokémon interesting concept fresh air well executed exploration quite nice although best open world gameplay graphics however bland outdated looks like 3ds years ago pretty disappointing since let games good looking better sword shield still low pokémon list nintendo switch list suggest buy end year start 2023 discount bland still little bit fun 
624,step forward steps back brilliant diamond got lot crap quality life updates made made fun ever pokémon really thought features like accessing anywhere infinite bag space forecasting would going forward series nope decided make things restrictive ever collecting items craft need tedious intentionally time consuming clearing bag hold anything else incredibly frustrating biggest things making less enjoyable could much could mention felt like spending hours typing bad could much better 
625,pros decent story fun gameplay restructure pokedex log tasks intuitive entertaining crafting mechanics tie open world gathering get ride menagerie impressive platforming decent new evolutions old favorites slick battle animations item management survival aspects punishing consequences stealth mechanics add another layer skill catching battling wild pokemoncons short establishing new camp farming plot side quest rewards virtually useless require unpleasant amount time accomplish sloppy lazy gameplay padding little content compared entries series hours postgame little purpose dex grind multiplayer pvp handful trainer battles battles wild encounters boss fights essentially janky unmemorable minigames mediocre graphics excuse running system hot looking badverdict clear albeit somewhat successful market test wait release multiple dlcs buy sword shield haven already 
626,lot really like might tad dislike idk give rating probably like overall fun mechanics get bit boring little story graphics worse games years ago story doesn get interesting like last arc love expand upon sequels legends subseries certainly preferred way play stands idk 
627,legends arceus great deal potential leading release end product sadly lacking nice see major attempt revitalize age old formula remained largely unchanged since gameboy execution muddled catching real time feels great alongside overhauled battle system content arceus simply repetitive enjoyed long term open world environments really fun explore first time around variety really lacking pokedex system requiring multiple captures interactions creature makes experience bit slog style initially appealing set distant past sinnoh region conceptually compelling unfortunately arceus fails live premise world environments tend totally without life character single proper town little way meaningful interaction graphics noticeably subpar official nintendo release plenty minor visual bugs distract experience story another letdown throughout considerable length nothing note really happens basic set events help including walls upon walls text characters really memorable serve basic story functions left wayside shame many characters really well designed several represent ancestors characters diamond pearl pretty interesting concept shame feel like throwaway element experience although initially quite excited learn world legends arceus takes place enthusiasm quickly fizzled playtime story petered disappointingly obvious expected way wish could separate disappointing parts arceus promising new gameplay formula simply possible new gameplay style could great new direction series simply repetitive current iteration compelling past first times experience also major letdown see utterly lifeless world characters story elements potential legitimately compelling explore world sinnoh exciting new ways legends arceus probably worth checking fan series want see new take gameplay formula expect much 
628,without doubt step right direction open world approach simply correct way franchise looks awful pop terrible textures legitimately ps2 quality look sky look feet frame rate drops considering breath wild 2017 run much better looking much stylized world much better performance switch embarrassing wild seem much organic compared deer red dead redemption told compare botw rdr2 makes money every goddamn year simply biggest franchise ever think bigger gta rdr zelda star wars marvel etc bound deliver something better fans doesn even voice acting want spend money want see next time fully open world different sections actual people towns buildings actual missions quests catch many fetch quests included animated full character battles gyms badges league good better resolution textures frame rate overall performance cannot give positive score 
629,pla fun really rough around edges parts make kinda want get parts actually engaged story said play felt bare bones repetitive making wish story 7for story one actually pretty decent even though feel use leaps logic people act conflict sometimes happen order progress story forward isn bad thing isn groundbreaking right happy stakes sound 6there wasn much music really stood mostly swear couldn hear overthe wild ending song really good though graphics agree everyone else graphics isn really good largest media franchise world could stepped end day could lot worse actually got play 6the play fun beginning main issue fact pretty much thing throughout entire break monotony boss fights genuinely fun fight wasn regular battle final score 10pla step right direction franchise really want see next type play style even instalment feels extremely bare currently 
630,nice gameplay see evolution series disgusting technical condition art design

632,underrating shouldn everyone e10 rating pending could harmful little children story like parental guidance gameplay like monster hunter world rise like open world zone frame rate enough adjust 60fps 1080p graphic similar sword shield however music open world area quests like much better like music calm peace relax brain without expressing anger believe enough strong graphic frame rate disappoint put low quality even though compared breath wild compare monster hunter world monster hunter rise hub system battle mechanic bad strong agile much combination confuse turns also moves small disappoint moves gone difficulty battling tricky everyone thing win higher level like post ending start without check point modeling doesn make sense like different colors confusing think shiny trade evolve yay fans think trade evolve would get stolen refuse give back impress add new items like linking cord returning quest money low rank progress slow progressing story also wasting poke balls catch limit amount waste buy think freak using graphic aaa technical issues rather finding good engine create also wasn much fun multiplayer 
633,nice compared last pokémon gamesa graphics poor improve lot way 
634,definitely step right direction however gamefreak needs build foundation need settlements interesting locations better told story voice acting maybe interactions world especially pros finally step forward franchise fun action centric boss battles catching feels great way better difficulty spike older gamescons horribly bad storytelling even handholding monster hunter world feels liveless interact eachother boring environments secrets ones discover story 
635,playing legends arceus fun freak finally tried something new improved gameplay make feel faster positive things right direction franchise hopefully bunch improvements find way main games good gameplay story direction cant ignore technical graphical problems called criticized art style problem looks really good find right camera angle look world legends arceus compare similar games worlds like monster hunter rise switch even exclusives like xenoblade snap upcoming kirby zelda botw many legends arceus looks awful steam pre alpha even n64 compare areas zelda ocarina time lot pop ups trees etc main town one houses copy paste awful environmental visuals lot areas feel empty also nearly points interests wants explore world course need next gen graphics realism look mind product big video company biggest franchise world generate millions dollars cant deliver visual standard fits size popularity franchise freak finances get help studios like every nowadays even halo horizon etc gets help many different studios console problem see way better looking exclusives switch lot crunch time company decision put games market high frequency essential content visuals get enough positive scores media games sold overall makes quite fun uses fresh optimized gameplay going another way main games decide want spend money looks like stucked past xbox360 ps3 era even point lower compared actual games feels like completely low effort product details soul end decision whether want support course company freak want see way bigger change biggest franchise world 
636,promising really worth full graphics poorly optimized still sword shield actually looks better promising change battle system exception trainer moving around thus taking multiplayer completely unnecessary dumbed 242 pokes region may upset alot trainers catching mechanic lacks potential cut middle man traditional lets stealth mechanic poor better catching foot battle story average story minor grim tales abilities natures longer thing evs ivs still despite competitive battles 
637,legends arceus expensive tech demo past several years transition sprite work models gamefreak made risky move turning console title shift come noticeable drop quality particularly department manages compatibility titles sword shield reduced pokedex rather sparse content legend arceus follows suit delivering really unique playstyle overshadowed generally devoid content ancient world sinnoh bland misses lot diverse biomes typically populate top generally feeling empty whole love probably still enjoy shake feeling released free demo team dedicating time fleshing world missions overall experience sure gamefreak looking cash grab grown plain lazy legend arceus hopefully set precedent paving way much better road 
638,good idea terrible execution pokémon tried innovate seems made absolute lack love franchise even though includes nice additions classics formula keeps repeating classic mistakes even going mention art direction graphic issues everybody seen still enjoyable experience though definitely best pokémon years even close extra points effort put trying innovate shouldn praise freak making feels unpolished sometimes even unfinished 
639,half baked price aaa feels like 2005 voices text cant jump cant pass terrain graphics horrible bad textures effort make art cant render proper graphics would expect 120fps switch graphics bad think barely pushing world lot pokemons thrown besides feels rather empty sense wonder exploring dull read good stuff people making going good direction better previous doesn make good 
640,love first hours play really fun interaction pokémon really good reaching later areas starts feel bit repetitive empty understand world supposed feel empty empty graphics good normally would mind feels unfinished hype got fact pokémon one biggest franchises nintendo kind disappointed higher expectations 
641,breath fresh air truly like direction going story decent controls nice pokémon seem bland previous pokémon titles fun fan series years ignore many inconsistencies npcs sometimes moving mouth talking sometimes uninspired landscapes caves specifically horrific graphics especially light shadow work lilac shimmer ground apparent reason framerate annoying repetitive dialogue pokémon glitching trees jokingly bad render distances multi billion dollar company year 2022 gameplay however really fun perfect fun really hope next legends improve things clearly lacks right great potential 
642,visuals improvement still bad 2022 play fun first gets repetitive catching trash pokémon 
643,breath fresh air players needed gamers content became repetitive great ideas let hope gen moving expanding expectations good 
644,step new exciting direction world feels eerily dead unfinished example severe lack music running around map stand around staring space instead playing chasing species kind spawn groups certain spots without much variation graphics rather poor finish main story hours like games easy cool things though especially open world aspect also fairly challenging events rare shiny catch quite legendaries catch enjoyed yeah something emptiness really puts 
645,let say good experiment battles mess little amount avoid almost battle want doesn make sense pokémon catch need train even bosses beaten without even using single pokémon joke wining experience even didn use battle system mess left much desired like enemy poisoned use calm mind buff next pokémon use agile style attack die poison another comes new uses quick attack new uses agile style attack new attacks turn finally calm mind effect expired joke understand held items abilities surely need improve future games also story bland postgame epic doesn makes much sense tutorial longest franchise get wrong liked catching exploring done better ever makes really fun play far best part rest meh 
646,really fun first due novelty got really boring really fast struggling stay awake time story bad let others tell otherwise backwashed horses semen bottom gutter story items annoying item storage even hope zones hopefully free patches could back time wouldn bought pokémon last one think pokémon anymore 
647,gets repetitive locks main story behind level grinding called legends little legendaries catching super fun battling broken fun fighting people feels abusive fight wild 
648,average running around world catching pokémon dream come true since little kid first time experienced pixelmon must say ugly horrendous textures lod pop ins landscape blur details ps2 era guessing budget went animations animations solid moves looks good pokémon idle alright models best story one nothing exciting like past pokémon games basic people rating perfect 100 100 insane ones giving average think honest review hopefully freak evolves step away past safe zones recommend buying playing 
649,fun first luster wears badly goes initially rated play see ugly visuals battling terrible style system horrible barely moves lots battles versus multiple potentially multiple turns even anything send die without even moving slow styles boss battles mess first couple fine 3rd start wonder designers thinking certain attacks basically impossible dodge goes idea simple spoiler example arcanine whole thing dashes across arena lava leave enough space dodge fine puts massive fire ring middle arena completely blocks anywhere dodge sideways tackles ring die mechanic makes sense feels frustrating cheap doesn require react dodge move way attacks point dodging tackle still like took fun complexity actual battles boss fights nightmare poorly designed attacks try dodge throwing balms also lot small irritating things like save file small satchel supposed constantly gathering things fun catching huge laundry list problems could ever get away like company series would dragged many issues outdated systems 
650,graphics anren good swear reused assets phantom hourglass sound ain good either music sounds like elevator music sound lack energy pacing extremely slow holds hand entire time far much text read gets boring quick much variety world alot depth combat aint much either character desings seeing moving around kinda cool 
651,graphics objectively terriblethere voice gruntingtons tons dialog cutscenesit really open world like sections open areasthe music uninspiredboss fights boringthe first hours trudgefeels like fan made gamegameplay loop alright crafting coolit tries mimic botw charm falls far short originality gameplay graphics music animation bugginess performance controls etc mean fan going get thinking getting probably disappoint 
652,mediocre get things right like seamless battles quality life comes changing movesets otherwise step back empty ugly world battles matter little since stealth throw ball everything even get one trainer battles offense based fun thanks new system good like catching nothing else point play much sacrificed like developed region towns ability battle others online 
653,gameplay boring throw pokeballs bosses orrible graphics even worse 
654,lazy reskin botw area low preforming grapichs bland overview really wanted like sloppy overall job taken one year polish world afraid releases done get great score reduced nostalgia worn 
655,non existent plot repetitive gameplay 2006 graphics thing throw balls 
656,compares monster hunter breathe wild doesn live expectations frame rate graphic makes look like solid ps3 hoping gets patches rating honestly fans would okay 
657,overall pokémon changes made exactly waiting years issues start realize though open world technically even less open world previous games straight stole world system monster hunter central hub filled npcs converse merchants crafting capabilities didn really even use recipes already example brown apricots preventing acquisition pokeballs love ball premier ball exploration zones wild area sword shield larger alpha pokémon permanent weaker versions dynamaxing nice really anything new supposed come special moves moves bought move trainer money money never thought pokémon would make money redundant wasted first million buying moves pokémon ended releasing back wild eventually recipes cost money costly upwards 000 far made million even quelled first noble need buy pokeballs potions upgraded versions cause craft bag space kind expensive awhile first upgrades never issue running space needing rest recover isn even anywhere close open world central hub separated loading screen every region regions travel without going back central hub walking buildings causes loading screens closed world wild pokémon spotting group something specific spawn larger numbers happens region time back central hub also things called time distortions summon evolution items stronger pokémon perfect level grinding coloured plates star dust crafted together star pieces spawn region time afterwards forced back central hub want spawn going back town also forced turn currently finished research gives money towards star rank star ranks purpose star pokémon levels would obey command even quelled kleavor equivalent gym badges previous games means time actually got mirelands every one pokémon collect one alpha form shiny forms hitting everything including noble mirelands miss fortune sisters trainers trainers trainers rushed unlock braviary stopping actually perfect dex like trainers fight handful leaders wardens diamond pearl clan even give balls pokémon people start real trainer encounter miss fortune sisters ambush time time follower like seriously yellow heartgold soulsilver lets best games follower pokémon stop removing feature combat evolved noticed love fact went way removed redundant moves harden condensed significant abilities like iron defense pokémon combat would perfect allow control pokémon battle combat like rpg instead turn based dodge block attack could easily done instead able run around combat trainer kind redundant little useless feature although yes say waiting years lower rating fact keep removing features series actually well attracted people spent 100 hours already perfect 115 242 available currently hopefully future updates dlc fix issues maybe try actually make open world claim one steal concept someone else 
658,predicted stupid director stupid unfortunately fanboys never admit think call gamers like lol predicted knew gamefreak going use timeline excuse add gyms trainers championship less directing needed nintendo fault sadly gamefreak owns part franchise

663,honestly say really apreciate zelda way attitude freak need pratice graphics really good movement physics little inaccurate cannot swim little cannot check life stamina positive try make boss fight fun another way fight overall mediocre improvement old games past 
664,honestly overall bad graphics nintendo count many graphical errors ran however mechanics new battle styles honestly really cool lot fun battling although story seems pretty shallow super well thought nothing new honest overall think definitely worth playing worth price tag 
665,good step forward brand ridiculous quality gamefreak leave technical development third parties 
666,love pokémon playing years mainline games honest objective playing playing playing hours bad think good either main complaint battles completely ruined system place absolutely balance hate new styles never use pokémon battle attack twice something styles used sometimes even times abilities would help battles exist etc feel like battles complete mess wild pokémon battles proper battles trainers exist battles every years trainer uses freaking pokémon areas big imo bad thing extremely confusing sometimes annoying lose interest exploring everything different pokémon walking around know people love massive open areas cup tea like something middle crafting annoying way worse satchel limit pay ton money get spot item wtf won talk graphics know best didn really bother stuff worse mentioned way much talking nonsense talking way much find dumb one area back camp every single time request village request another area dumb waste time believe pulled change pokémon access objects store mandatory back camp much qol even get started losing ton objects pass absolutely miss battles real ones absolutely miss gyms marked objective pokémon league etc people may like type legends pokémon always battles gyms league pokémon master best play bored stop playing takes lot back doesn really hook force play least finish wasn free say love overworld pokémon possibility see shynies like battling send pokémon quick appreciate personally hope typical spin hurts admit way fun sword shield hope gen takes good mechanics like overworld quick battles etc focused typical gyms etc massive areas best pokémon everrrr people say hell even main essence franchise bad best either least give back competitive battles gyms would give 
667,took whole new direction different setting visuals much improved gameplay rather addictive truly feels like always exploring seeing wild 
668,ign italy review accurate critic review reviewer understands analyze systems interact one another instead mindlessly wowed open world genuine improvements traditional pokémon formula really improvements simply seem made without consideration whatsoever affect rest let start good non random seamless battles great want get fight wild pokémon toss one pokémon near bam battle loading screen battle transition effect instantly battle mode still free move around battle going see angle even get hit attacks careless stand feel like battling catch pokémon without battle great mind two main alterations freak made traditional formula good ideas unfortunately noticeably bad knock effects seems freak either didn notice compensated rather amateur ways previous pokémon games luxury hiding pokémon tall grass outside sword shield never actually showed wild means presence pokémon part player suspension disbelief totally behaviors listed pokédex never see legends arceus hand shows pokémon wild stand wander around bit live world homes behaviors interact one another simply exist wait caught fought much obvious visual fidelity issues makes world feel lifeless oddly empty battle catching speeds insane extent could catch everything without fighting would extremely quickly freak needed let happen large number people equate time spent money value seems freak implemented two solutions order prevent runtime drastically shortened first pokémon fall three categories friendly skittish aggressive friendly pokémon caught battle special requirements throw ball skittish pokémon caught battle long see first run away aggressive pokémon cannot caught outside battle whatsoever must fought captured traditional manner freak made pokémon aggressive made super convenient change formula set things force traditional formula anyway part secondly far damningly pokédex requires multiple catches multiple victorious battles multiple observations pokémon move use checklist items catch without seen dex entry specific pokémon complete really reason justification provided amounts repetitious busywork seems obvious another solution problem made playing faster convenient need keep playing roughly amount time catching faster require lot catches instead traditional one done battling controllable randomized require specific number battles pokémon player fight multiple times anyway worse virtually everything revolves around dex completion never gets interesting complex time sidequests ask complete dex entries outright things complete dex entries main quest also requires dex entries one note loop freak could done much interesting things good core changes make pokémon appear really live world require player observe record behaviors eat live use switch dex similar botw treated tablet actual device permit player directly record dex info perhaps fill blank fields selection pre written answer options dex central interesting things dex seem like brainer unfortunately freak settled make usual stuff way end result decidedly repetitive lackluster hope freak figures went wrong really isn hard see holes 
669,good graphics would goty doesnt get repetitive really nice 
670,open world like graphics one main features plays important role cannot must ignored title sold otherwise title technical scarcity nobody would bought let take fanboy mask let look well hand moves foundations renews titles fun intriguing etc want talk world square hills types trees copy paste whole map zero dungeons cross tunnels texture everywhere undriveable mounts camera leaves cabbages mountains change shape move away tall grass made strips rotate camera telecameraand could title find absurd offensive towards put effort love creating games 
671,one step ahead two behind could done little could new standard gameplay wise

679,four bosses great way catch amazing every way awesome 
680,really let gaming community inability give objective reviews excited moment heard year ago really wanted like watched development saw red flag red flag seems suffer lazy open world design syndrome illusion endless opportunity boils reveal void meaningful content redundant scarce gameplay loops seeing pokémon overworld control trainer poke balls great ideas get people excited think much missing look legendary open world games like tes gta botw games base gameplay loops slinging swords sorcery stealing cars come together support epic overarching stories guilds colorful characters impactful decisions lot fun pokémon let lot people complained think games suffer lot problems hasty development lazy uninspired technical issues didn see predecessors negative reviews legends wanted like arceus clearly didn get budget would taken properly pull really great idea imagine guild plotlines like tes working way gyms saving pokémon ranger refining pokémon breeder imagine colorful characters sending meaningful adventures becoming companions get super boiled feels like one two years development work team come gaming community tell straight face pokémon breath wild insulting team put together masterpiece botw like saying honda spoiler japanese ferrari smhthat said optimistic franchise going forward massively positive response seen despite least obvious shortcomings tip makers community hungry types gameplay arceus displayed maybe pay way 
681,quite like fun sunk hours weeks seems baked know going complete enjoy flawed environment stale poor pop horrible exploring biggest complaint map map corner find constantly opening map top place one guided marker time refreshing hard want would recommend good could much see decent base idea flawed execution 
682,first novelty gave heaviness seeing items completed single pokémon pokédex many repetitive although initially nice capture gave sense annoyance stay hours behind take behind catch prefer classic capture method already miss continuing seems always first area everything first last especially 10h start feel weight graphics pasture full pokémon longer distinguish isn even tier order anything like always talking order understand tools purse pokédex quick powerful moves despite facilities several times lose gain turn stand time press see attack turn pokémon obliged innovate like news moves fill items especially rise rank situation cannot continue story graphics clutter innovate focus must creatures interaction want rank get ultraballs etc able catch strong limited forced register repetitively wasting time cannot continueost absent except struggles situations powerful moves lose beauty clashes one move knock finish everything quickly people always complained difficulty freak decided get exp points end fight makes sense makes everything difficult frustrating many 
683,wasn sure make arceus first announced one hand tpc appeared changing battle mechanics adding real time elements hand poor graphics empty overworld left lot desired also unclear whether would experimental one attempt change evolve series core mechanics someone played since first titles finds latest entries stale disappointing went low expectations legends arceus trailers promised decent story attest writing receives focus usual presentation frankly sucks still voice acting interactions consisting characters awkwardly standing talking real draws revamped combat catching systems changes gameplay perfect make arceus initially far captivating preceding games first importantly aim poke balls interact directly field exploring able easily shuffle next line battle well send harvest materials trees shrubs mineral outcroppings essential crafting healing items poke balls many either run attack avatar sight got options dodge like dark souls sneak around try nab without spotted ambush start fight lure repel food run away also get multiple mounts ride across several open areas combat tweaked many minor ways dodging occasionally aside bosses fight real time traditional four move turn based core combat remains introduces agile strong variations attacks faster weaker stronger slower best moves easily switched outside battle making infinitely convenient swap movesets really opens lot possibilities starter sweeper one battle defensive mon catching tool next held items longer exist status effects tweaked weaker thankfully disappear battle changes well limited pool teachable moves make certain builds dedicated physical special sweepers far effective interest get battles done quickly possible especially since often find fighting multiple wild one part changes also help flow smoother since covering lot ground great outdoors often atop mounted however due kneecapping potential builds owing removal breeding lack variety foes making fine tuning afterthought grew bored battles halfway gyms breeding trainer battles instead spend time gathering crafting pokedex time dex entries end catching trading also tasked specific battle tasks need fulfill ten challenges per isn daunting feel like busywork brings biggest weakness world mean fact limited ways interact environments 242 mixed bag species models often well animated day night weather cycles add variety runs smoothly minimal loading sugarcoating fact graphics environments subpar featuring empty worlds trees textures would look bad gamecube pop heavy aliasing bland color palette tempered muted art direction testament strength arceus core mechanics bland environments lack trainer battles unfinished feel completely sink experience perhaps expectations low going safely say spite many faults arceus fun title since days also shows franchise general still potential may sound like faint praise someone critical mainline franchise years think fans appreciate real time elements easily swappable movesets additions world building lore hope nintendo able build upon established title utilize take franchise forward bold new direction rated balance shills 
684,nice wonderful milking brand looks good purely terms gameplay scheme nintendo releases without really thinking creative anymore bought anyway 
685,story new mechanics truly amazing mark great progress old franchise everything let terrible engine brings everything amount details terribly low framerates well acceptable resolution low even docked mode looks plays really bad world simply empty still framerate dips quite often really sad new story mechanics whole idea great even blame switch state games like botw xenoblade really well made open world major disappointment considering games always sell like crazy 
686,completing spending hours sadly say hard pass reply wanted like tried like reason even beat end say lot small things overall irritated thought time playing excused cause buggie aaa titles give credit world playable sad age thing 
687,hoping finally catch times feels like developed released years ago even convinced publishers developers games aim milk nostalgic players children started adventure minimum amount effort maximum amount profits looks like became motto still could enjoy bits pieces falling asleep time

693,wanted unpaid job looks average better sword shield good kids guess desperate 
694,paper gets excited years years repeated different skins comes new tries different problem new idea feels cut short never truly fleshed visuals boring flat people seem confuse graphics things like ultra realism rtx speaking simple graphics still manage set apart look visually interesting needs voice acting kind lack voice acting feels low budget boring even grunt would bring point book point play fun would enjoyed open movement play bigger part battles think point start move away turn base battles final fantasy great solution remake could toggled enjoy forced onto player combat could much real time heck even getting rid one limit battling would improvement feels like picked time period could finally something different formula chose lean fully left half baked new features leave wanting hopefully lead future games something advertisement sell merchandise 
695,pathfinding work map really painful focus graphics come nintendo world biomutant alive 
696,good world feels empty graphics outdated pretty inconsistent story characters weak even novelty wears gameplay loop really repetitive really needed time development create world worth exploring refine new ideas right feels like precursor great definitely worth price tag enjoyed games strong connection franchise likely enjoy appreciate changes probably winning new fans hoping actually take time next one run new ideas could make genuinely amazing 
697,better pokémon britian could way better whole lot useless empty space nothing around catch interest looks like environment department took texture modeling budget buildings looks good character models need touch lighting reveals models polygons occasion characters mouths continously open close like singing bass wall completing pokedex tedious busy work ever completion criteria random sometimes requires interactions single type pokémon models visibly appear disappear rendering range pokémon animation visibly tanks frames distance evolution animation best music top notch 
698,good idea horrible execution boring part story make sense 
699,honest graphic section leaves lot desired even boring cancine times pokémon legends arceus understand seems good new fighting mechanics however continue drag certain problems sword shield series deny fun facing great created freak however could notice made love affection accompanied pokémon games

704,things start fun exciting quickly become redundant monotone completing pokedex overkill completing wonder actually even bothered trying complete side quests giving nothing additional resources store joke never actually buy pokeball potion entirety gamethe lack villages towns pretty horrendous another village yet nothing worthwhile storyline critics mentioned npcs also blatantly empty worthwhile point storyline even could cut chase end instead adding double triple plot twists completed tossed completed section may may take dlcs future really feels like dlcs part first place overall verdict borrow friend complete story bother complete pokedex buying stuff side quests give little addition 
705,looks like reviewers played hours otherwise cant explain good ratingsgame looks like trash relatively short time everything repeats 
706,pretty crazy get away switched formula imo definitely best however done poorly looks like still development made small company little income graphics look crap npcs sit idling theyre actually part surrounding artificially placed gameplay loo
