       "       'this is a new masterpiece brought to the pokemon community  i ll try to go over the positive elements and things to improve on  i ll also try to make it free of spoilers too  but things to improve on  you ve rated this game 10 and it has things to work on   sure do  i m rating a game based on the fun i m having  and the urge to continue playing  and both those things are over the roof  i m having a blast  and the people around me who bought it too seems to be in the same place  so this is totally worth a 10 in my opinion am i giving this a 10 just because it is pokemon  absolutely not  pokemon in the last few years has been hard to finish  in the sense of getting boring before you get to the good part   the end game lets start with the positives   catching mecanics are really fun  using items to lure in  stun  scare pokemon while having new pokeballs that play with distance and surprise is a blast  even if i have every pokemon in my pokemon home up to this game  i m enjoying catching everything i see for the first time in years  trying to catch a pokemon by surprise is also really rewarding and fun   overworld use of pokemon  being able to chose which pokemon to throw in at any time is really interresting  like preparing the right pokeball in case something goes wrong when catching  or knowing a pokemon of a certain type is hidden somewhere and using the best pokemon to uncover it   crafting and in game economy is meaningful  the world is full of resources to look for and the money has its uses so you don t hoard it   pokemon has been giving too much to players in the last few games  to the point where it s hard to spend it all   pokedex feels like you re really working on it  as it is not filling itslef on its own with just 1 encounter  while a good portion of it just fills itslef while playing normally  i often stop to check on the pokemon in front of me to see if i can work on something  the pokedex progression is also the game progression and it really feels like a fun goal to work on   combat  some base elements makes it more refreshing  like status effect for example  none of them last forever anymore  but they have some other effects  like the new sleep  drowsy  that makes the pokemon receive more damage  this makes such moves more interresting  in the previous game i was running around with a thunderwave pokemon and catching most of my stuff with that  the strong and agile style are interresting combined with the combat timeline  it s refreshing while staying close to tradition   ivs evs  are gone  replaced by a new system that is simpler  although i didn t mind the old system  it was a bit tedious and getting redundant for me  so i welcome the change here   breeding  while at first i was shocked that it was removed  was a boring portion of the game in my opinion  while i wouldnt mind having it back with a bit of rework  i feel the game is better without it for this iteration   alpha pokemon  really fun little challenges to catch these everywhere  love it   shiny hunting is now fun in this game  gosh  it s weird to say that   things to work on   the story  while it is a good story for pokemon  i m not feeling bored like previous recent games  but i m not feeling like i want to rush to know what s next  maybe it is for the better though because i ve taken my merry time to explore and experience the world and that is fun  competitive  they really need to bring battle between players in the future  it feels off to not have that option and it a fun part of the endgame to build a good team to battle   graphics  i m not sure why so many people complain here  the graphics are ok  even if not on par with games like breath of the wild  they are still ok  pokemon has never been praised for its graphics    the lightning seems off in some places or when it rains  but other than that  it s totally fine   battle with noble pokemon  while i do like the general idea and i m having fun during these battles  its a little offsetting to throw food into a pokemon s face to calm it down  like hell i would calm down if you threw me my favorite food in the face    the idea is fun to play  but weird as a concept   inventory  i don t mind moving things to storage and managing my inventory  but surely some things can be done to help that process    same for pokemon  boxes  i guess  i feel i miss a couple things to improve the usage of both of these ',\n",

       "       'this is probably the most unique entry into the pokemon series since its inception  being able to run around the world  catching and running away from wild pokemon is a real treat and really gave the series a fresh new spin  it can be a little weird at times due to the controls not being that fluid and can be very clunky if you re trying to switch to a specific item or pokemon to fight at times but it works very well  the battle system is similar but has its own quirks that separate it from previous entries  the lack of abilities and held items now give type immunities  such as ground being immune to electric and so on  more importance as these wild pokemon can have very high stats for their levels  especially alpha pokemon who can overcome a massive level advantage to deal significant damage to alot of pokemon  i had to unlearn alot of standard pokemon battling tips that i was not prepared for  it s not bad per say  but you might find yourself in a tough spot very quickly if that 20  level advantage you thought would make up the difference for a neutral pokemon  who has a special move that your pokemon is weak too i d almost say this game would be a better experience for people not experienced with pokemon  but i d recommend it to basically anyone who might interested  the clunky controls and the usual poor framerate that comes with playing on the switch aren t too much of a hassle at the end of the day  the game is just fun and i really hope they continue to do games like this in the future ',\n",

       "       'so we finally have a game that gamefreak have put some effort in  however does it actually work  minor spoilers if you haven t watched trailers so be warned so my first sitting i sat there for 9 hours straight giving this an honest go so i can put together a fair review  i played it all on stream and said my pros and cons there but here they are in text for others to read and decide on if they want to purchase  i have now put in 35 hours i can put together a fair review overall  yes this game is worth and i am very impressed gamefreak took this risk and i hope future games use this type of system  there are some things they could have done better which i ll go into first pokémon at night could have more of a variety  every map has 80  of the same pokémon at night except a few that are exclusive to that map at night  it s most driffloons you find which is annoying  but during the day there s a variety on each map  it s only at night it s lacking some side quests need some work  they need to be more descriptive or give you the maps name at least  some of them give you a quest where you have to go an area but that name isn t on any map at all  someone would have mentioned the name but you d have to remember the map needs more little towns for immersivness  you have people coming from other existing places to your town  however you never actually find those towns  instead of having random quests on the maps to pick up you could have little towns you go pick them up from and then you could learn a little more of how those places operate at the same time  except you just hear of all the places and never get to see them which is a shame pokémon in the wild could have behaviour characteristics  get too close to another pokémon they could argue with each other or even fight  have bidoofs collecting wood to make dams  beatifly landing on trees and sucking the nectar  just things to give the pokémon more life  they do go to sleep at night  if they don t despawn and get replaced with night pokémon which does happen  now on to why it s such a great game system   the open world style really suits this game and it s a huge step forwards for the franchise  being able to choose to try and catch a pokémon right away or battle it is great   what s even better is being able to move while battling  this doesn t do anything but it lets you look around and if you annoy more than one pokémon you can end up battling as many enemies that are around you crafting   now this actually lets you do something with the open world style  collect materials which you can find on the ground or get as rewards for catching fainting pokemon  you might think it s a tedious thing but you don t need to craft you can just smash through the content however crafting does add a little more to do for those that like this type of thing  collecting recipes and crafting those new recipe s to make fights easier in the future mounts   you can run fast  break stuff  swim or fly and you can switch between them whenever you want with the d pad and if your currently on your running mount and go into water it will automatically switch to your swimming mount  great addition gamefreak  well done  however i wish you could actually fly around and fight flying pokémon in the sky danger   now you can actually faint from pokémon attacking you  this could do with being harder though it is very easy to dodge pokémon attacks or get away from them  however the fear of you actually fainting and loosing items you went out and crafted bought is a cool addition to the game  alpha pokémon are a great addition too  you can litterally throw your pokémon out anywhere and call them back  so you catch an alpha pokémon you can compare it s size to a regular one  you have a choice to either fight the wild pokémon or catch them right off the bat  even aggressive pokémon can be approached with the correct items  i ve caught about 10 alpha pokémon without battling them the side quests are both great and have their flaws at the same time  most of the side quests have different styles quests  have a little story too them too but then around 1 5th side quests are just  fill x pokemons dex entry   which is too many in my opinion  your planning to finish all dex entries anyway if you want the reward overall this game is a hard 9 10 i love that gamefreak went for a risk and put so much effort into a new game rather than us getting a new 3ds game that s slightly bigger in map size  this is a great direction for new pokémon games  i see this as the botw of the series  this is a test to see if the audience enjoy this style of game and then in future we will get more immersive maps  maps will towns we are going to end up having a truly flawless game if they continue in this direction and don t just use this style of spin off games in the future ',\n",

       "       'i ve been playing pokemon games since gen 1  i ve enjoyed every pokemon game since then  pokemon legends arceus is a great video game  perhaps one of the best on switch if not the absolute best  but it is not the best pokemon game per say first off  graphically  it looks fine  pokemon games have never been visually impressive and i personally don t see a whole lot of difference between this game graphically and something like breath of the wild  the sounds are great  the music sound track hits hard and the game itself makes good use of sound effects  sometimes you can kind of tell where a pokemon might be just by listening  it helped me a lot as it was much easier to tell when a pokemon was about to attack  performance is fine  the game is 30 fps  but it s a consistent 30 fps  personally  while i do prefer 60 fps  i don t actually mind 30 fps as long as it s consistent and the framerate here is good enough for me of course though  this is a pokemon game  so gameplay is what really matters  this game is very fun and very addictive  it s relaxing to go out looking for pokemon  the boss battles need a bit of work  but generally i ve had fun with this game  it s very addictive  i don t have a whole lot of free time due to work and stuff  so the fact that i ve played about 50 hours of this game in just the last week that it s been out says a lot  the crafting system is a nice idea  but it needs a bit of work to be really good  a lot of the resources you gather are only good for one or two specific items and that seems like a bit of a waste  it would be a nice if you had to think about which resources you wanted to use for which items and if each resource had a few different uses  as it is  you have resources that are very specifically for certain types of pokeballs  resources that are very specific for certain types of medicine  etc  it gets to a point where you simply just don t collect certain resources because you simply have no good use for them  the pokemon themselves however is what really matters  battling them is fun and switching between the overworld and the battles themselves has never been better  i do think the move pool is lacking  i noticed a lot of moves seem to have been taken out of the game and while in some ways that helps balance the battles  it makes it difficult to get the right moves for certain pokemon and type coverage becomes difficult  speaking of variety  pokemon is where this game needs a lot of work  the pokedex is only about 250 pokemon  the smallest we ve ever had outside of remakes  most of those pokemon are from sinnoh  which makes sense given the story  however  it s a bit disappointing to see such a limited number of pokemon in this type of enviornment  there was about 10 12 pokemon that seem to be available in every area and with as many pokemon are there are  this simply shouldn t be the case  i know people have complaints about sword and shield  but this is something they really got right with the wild area in sword and shield  so it s disappointing to see how limited the selection of pokemon is here  a 400 500 pokemon size of pokedex would make a lot more sense here the story is very good  it s not the absolute best story we ve ever gotten in pokemon  but it easily makes the top 5  my only real complaint is that there is much too much handholding through the story  in other pokemon games  this makes sense  given how linear the games are in the first place  here however  it makes a lot less sense given the open world enviornments  all i really want to do is explore the enviornment and they almost seem to force the story upon you instead  i do like the rewards for pokedex completion and completion of the game itself as you go  this game gives the most insentive to keep going out of all the pokemon games and easily gives the best rewards  you get money for pokedex completion and i find myself continuing to catch as many pokemon as i can so i can get more money to get more items and clothes  i do wish there were more clothing options  but the ones that are there are good  there s also way more shiny hunting options than usual  which is nice for people who enjoy that sort of thing all in all  pokemon legends arceus is a very good game  but if you are looking to pick up your first pokemon game  i d recommend sword and shield first and then checking this out afterwards  this is easily the better game  but sword and shield is the better pokemon experience where you get to see and do more pokemon related stuff  i d say both games are 100 percent must plays for anyone interested in pokemon  pokemon legends arceus is very good groundwork for future games and i certainly plan on following to see what they continue to do with the pokemon legends series  i think with a bit of refinement and just generally taking everything a bit farther  this very well could be the future of main line pokemon games and that excites me ',\n",

       "       'i was looking at all of the negative reviews for this game and all of them were just complaining about the graphics or the difficulty  the game is definitely more difficult than some of the most recent games but it s not too difficult  when i faint or lose  i don t feel like it s unfair because it s mostly my own fault  and the graphics are actually a step up compared to pokémon sword and shield  although they are a step up  they aren t too great at times  sometimes you will see parts of hills in the distance randomly load in right in front of you or even sometimes tree or pokémon on rare occasions  overall  the graphics i d give a low 7 10  but every other aspect of the game is phenomenal  and a big step up compared to previous entries of the series and is why i m rating this game a 9 out of 10  this game truly is a great game and is a big step up compared to previous games  especially comparing this game to pokémon brilliant diamond and shining pearl  and anyone who thinks that this game is somehow  worse  or  just as bad  as the other games  is completely wrong  this game gives amazing changes and some small changes you may not recognize your first time playing through the game  you can tell they put a lot of thought and detail into so many different aspects of the game  there are some problems as far as the graphics and nintendo switch optimization but other than that  this game is wonderful and the best time i ve had playing a pokémon game in years ',\n",

       "       'this game is a huge leap for its franchise and just a fun and good pokémon game you start with a good and deservedly long tutorial if you are a long die hard fan of the pokémon franchise  you immediately notice the fundamental changes that were made  you actually get a good introduction into the new movement and the catching system  if you are someone that is in some way unbiased and pick up the game because it looks interesting  it is just as good  unlike many pokémon games before this  e g  sword   shield   this game actually has depth and story that i would let adults enjoy  it s a world in which pokémon are wild  people are afraid of them and don t even dare to touch them  if you do not come prepared or act rashly  you can very well lose your life from an npc s standpoint  it s not an exaggeration to say that this is the situation people of the hisui region are facing  the tutorial doesn t start with you yet again saving the professor from a life and death situation  choosing your starter and off you go    i like it graphically  there is a lot of room for improvement  textures are somewhat presentable  playing in handheld mode eases the pain but once you plug it into the dock and hook that thing up to a 4k tv  you just notice the many rather unattractive aspects this game sadly has to offer being already on the visual points  the attack animations are crisp and look very good npc s finally look more like actual people with more added facial expressions  less repetitive movements  look up sun and moon as a bad example  and a imo somewhat better dialogue in general most character designs are creative  stick out and are memorable  their personalities are not nearly as one sided as what we are used to in the latest games so that even e g  a group of thieves you encounter after a couple hours of gameplay explains  that they just steal in order to survive  there is just more reasoning behind the tasks and conversations you are faced with the  multiplayer   if you can even call it that   is so minuscule that you would forget there even is such a thing  i would say that it actually adds to immersion that you are mostly alone in these open world levels but i would still gladly take an improvement to the current solution of just picking up other players lost items for a slight reward trainer battles are very scarce  in a way it makes sense  since there shouldn t be many trainers around anyway  speaking logically   it doesn t lack of fighting in general since you do this more than enough with other wild pokémon but there is a slight lack of the  ol tiny bit of competitiveness you would get in defeating the elite four  i would like to see more options to choose and challenge certain npcs for a battle  there actually is a training ground in the village that story wise is maybe used only a couple times   by the time i have played  there was only one battle on it   there is no real fighting interaction you can do to challenge someone the music is good  the sound design has gotten better  i e  you actually hear an echo of your pokémons screams when fighting in ruins  and the engaging gameplay with its new fundamentals of stealthily sneaking up to pokémon in order to catch them  actual trainer vulnerability and the other already mentioned things is just fun and that s what this game is  fun to me it is safe to say that this level of lore  depth  atmosphere and gameplay and design should be the new standard for this franchise ',\n",

       "       'disclaimer  if you care a lot about graphics and not gameplay  this isn t the game for you  giving the game a 3 just because the graphics are lacking is shallow i have been playing pokemon since diamond and pearl on the ds  and this is the most fun i ve had with a pokemon game since  this is mostly due to the well structured gameplay loop  there are lots of ways you can approach battling and catching pokemon  and this freedom really defines the entire game  instead of pressing a button to run away from a battle  you can just actually run away  you can move during a battle giving you any perspective you d like  once you get past the tutorial  you are free to explore a large area with lots of danger and excitement  besides that  every mechanic implemented is streamlined to perfection  the gameplay is a much needed and revolutionary step in the pokemon franchise  the gameplay earned itself a 10 10 a valid point of critique is that the graphics are lacking  don t get me wrong  there are some moments where the game looked pretty  but overall it s very very mediocre  the textures are often compared to the wii era  and let me tell you  they re not far off  furthermore  there is the usual pop in of trees and rocks which isn t always noticeable  but is very jarring when you do notice it  luckily the pokemon themselves do not pop in as heavily  they are usually seen from further away at the expense of a lower frame rate  the pop in has been improved from earlier titles like pokemon sword and shield  overall the graphics leave a lot to be desired  though it does add enough to game overall  therefore i rate this department a 6 10 i was pleasantly surprised by the sound design in the game  though i didn t expect anything else from the gamefreak veteran go ichinose  the soundscapes in legends arceus take the immersion to a new level for the series  the world of pokemon has never felt more alive  my favorite sounds are those of the player movement  rolling  sprinting  crouching in the grass  throwing a pokeball  i am a massive fan of this amount of detail  the soundtracks in the game are subtle  and reminds one of zelda breath of the wild  there are some beautiful renditions in there of older soundtracks of the sinnoh region  one of my favorite being jubilife village  the games sound earned itself a 10 10 people asked for better animations  and they got it  there are a lot of new animations for the pokemon themselves  the moves  the npcs and much more  gamefreak outdid themselves in this department  it s really the little things that sold me on the animations  pokemon actually make eye contact  the trainer can be seen showing actual emotions  after a heavy battle  the player often wipes off some sweat  the player can get hit by a pokemon s moves and you can see the player retreat a pokemon to their pokeball  sure  they re small things but it s never seen before in the pokemon franchise  a recurring theme in pokemon legends arceus  there are some moments where gamefreak could ve done more  or better said  at least something  the game still fades to black in cutscenes where two characters are supposed to interact with each other  which just comes across as lazy  it s an easy technique to avoid animating something  and for real time events that s acceptable  however  we are talking about cutscenes here  gamefreak s cutscenes are outdated  and it s sad they didn t improve them for this game  there are lots of things to love in the animation department  but it s not perfect  therefore the animations are a 9 10 for me to conclude  pokemon legends arceus is a game worth your time  whether you are new to the franchise or a veteran  everything combined  this game is a 9 10 ',\n",

       "       'for me  this is the second best entry into the pokemon series  although  as a disclaimer  i ve only played each of the mainline games and remakes  and let s go  if that counts as a separate thing   arceus has been my absolute favourite since i played blue for the first time in the 90s and this new game was beaten out by nostalgia and fond memories only to be honest the minimalistic art style is reminiscent of older japanese artwork  it s a beautiful and moving take on simplistic world that supports the engaging core mechanics  it s true that it s not as beautiful as some more recent games  however for me it is clear that this is not what arceus sets out to be when we talk about open world games  the narrative often becomes about that world and the interactions with that world by the character and story  arceus doesn t set out to have you move mountains within the world but instead exist as a part of a theorised greater whole  much like the thesis of the game s story  how do we exist as humans within this greater world filled with potentially terrifying pokemon who are by default stronger than we are  the game asks who are we compared to each other and who are we compared to these creatures  rather than who are we compared to the world  for me  the beauty is further than skin deep and the graphical minimalism of the world supports this greatly arceus gives a stage to often lesser used pokemon  it asks you to think about your pokemon journey further than  who is the strongest    and it puts the exploration and mystery back in the genre i loved it and i sincerely hope they produce more in this vein  highly recommend ',\n",

       "       'the game design is brilliant  it s probably the most fun i ever had playing through the game  the fast pace batlle and catch mechanics are the things the hold the idea together  if they were slow  it would be incredibly boring to complete the pokedex  but is quite enjoyable when you can t catch and battle in a matter of seconds  with no intro or unnecessary dialogue for me  the fact that the game is not truly open world is not a negative  it would be nice to fly over all the regions  yes  but it did t seem necessary completing the pokedex being the main goal of the game its great  i tried to play the game without looking for tips and managed to catch every regular mon    minus spiritomb and evolving some of them  more on this later   the thrill when i found cleffa  grotle and munchlax    3 of the last 4 needed    was one of the best in 30 years of playing videogames  i think 237  or 242  is a decent number of pokemon to have in the game  the max they could have gone  i believe  is 300  more than that  would be a slog to get to arceus the last one i need was cherubi  which i imagined that would be in one of the trees where you can find cherrim  which i found two while going through the first part   but i delayed because it s kind boring going back to the village over and over again the one negative thing i have to say about the pokedex arceus mechanic is that is stupid to lock arceus behind some mechanics that are almost impossible to find on your own  i killed the overkqwil the game gives  so that s on me  but i would never find that you need to use the same mechanic 20x times  the same goes do wyrdeer    i m not sure if you cand find it on the wild but ursaluna is the worst one  i tried every item  so by discarding the ones you use on other pokemon  i imagined you needed the peat block  but  for me  is insane you need to evolve during a full moon  which is quite rare  it s insane because 99  of players will need to check guides for it  which is bad  it s also impossible to find manaphy if you don t have diamond and pearl  which i don t  but as it is not necessary to get to arceus  it s ok the spiritomb mechanic  for me  it s ok  there is not a particular impossible wisp to find and  while doing the other stuff  i managed to find 93 out of 108  as i had done everything else and was clocking 70 hours  i decided to check a guide to get to arceus  but  if you dedicate time to seach for them while doing other stuff  as i said  it s not bad the research mechanic is good  while it gets boring by the end  the game makes you cycle your team and train almost every pokemon  which is a first for me in the franchise  usually plan my team ahead and use 6 to 9 max   and you can get to a 10 research level really fast with almost all of them  the few you don t  it s actually a nice challenge  because they are rarer pokemon and you need to make the most of every encounter you have i m not going through the mass outbreaks and distortions  but they are a nice change of pace and are very helpful to completing your dex the bosses are major win  simply battling a high level pokemon it s ok    the alpha mechanic makes some battles really tough     but introducing a different approach made the game really fresh for me  and the battles were really tough and satisfying after i managed to get through  palkia was a great boss battle and the one traditional trainer vs trainer you get in the end game was really nice  i understand that some people may wanted more trainer battles  but it didn t seem necessary for me but  the best new thing is  easily  the riding mechanic  switching wyrdeer  basculegion and braviary is great  it s a very smooth experience and may very well be the best movement mechanic in video game history  not exaggerating  being that good  the game never feels empty  i played almost all the praised triple a open world games and  even though there is much more on the screen  they usually have more boring parts   you never need to spend more than 10 seconds to get from pokemon a to b  which is great ',\n",

       "       'game freak finally tried this time this was a major step in the right direction for the franchise after decades of stagnation  so far i have put roughly 16 hours into the game and am still loving it  the novelty of catching and battling pokemon in an open world setting still feels fresh after all these hours and i can see myself playing this game for hundreds of hours  i have played every single pokemon game since the original diamond and pearl and i can confidently say that this is the best pokemon game i have played in a long time   game freak have finally managed to make the pokemon game we ve all wanted since we were kids the pros  gameplay is better than ever and fits seemlessly in an open world  gameplay loop is addicting and rewarding  feels like a more mature game with a higher difficulty  maps only get better after the first area  ambience music is beautiful and immersive the cons  graphics could have been better if the game was given just a few more months  ai is better than sword and shield   but still has a long way to go  story is bland starting with the negatives  the game is rough around the edges and if game freak s games weren t rushed  they could have taken a few more months to polish it and make it look even better  this goes for the ai too  as pokemon are often just sitting around doing nothing  luckily  depending on the pokemon they will react differerntly to seeing you   some will get aggressive and chase you  some will run away from you  and some won t care at all  unfortunately  even the most aggressive pokemon are extremely easy to run away from and don t present much of a threat  it is certainly a step up from the lifeless pokemon ai from sword and shield  but with a second entry i hope to see pokemon acting uniquely within their own habitats similar to pokemon snap  lastly  i found myself ignoring a lot of the main story as i couldn t get engaged with it  and preferring to explore and do side quests instead while the graphics  ai  and storytelling could use some improvement  it s apparent that game freak spent a lot more time on the more important aspect of this game  the gameplay  gameplay is king in legends arceus and it s easily the most addicted i ve been to a pokemon game since i was a kid  everything is very seemless in the open world setting as they finally ditched the time consuming and dated battle screens and loading screens in between areas  this game feels like it actually belongs on the switch   unlike the awfully outdated sword and shield  the game loop is very addicting as you go into the open fields to collect resources to craft items which will help you on your journey as you catch as many pokemon as you can to complete your pokedex  most importantly  pokemon has long suffered from the criticism that it s too easy   while this game isn t hard by any stretch  it does feel like the game has matured for older audiences quite a bit  i ve noticed pokemon battles are usually a lot more difficult as the game no longer warns you which pokemon your opponent is sending out beforehand  and the ai generally seems to be a lot smarter when attacking you   my pokemon got knocked out frequently the first area  obsidian fieldlands  is a bit bland and may not be the best first impression for gamers  but fortunately after the first area  the maps get significantly more interesting  the biomes change to swamplands  to coastlands  to clifflands  to snowy mountains   all with unique ways to traverse them as the game continuously gives you new pokemon to help you get around  the music adds a key element to what makes exploring so much fun  the ambience music in this game is beautiful and adds just that extra bit of immersion when exploring  especially for players of diamond and pearl  or even the remakes  the music is often remixed versions of the old soundtracks of sinnoh  and visiting old places and seeing them realized in an open world  such as the lakes  makes for a very nostalgic throwback all in all  the closest switch games i can compare this to is a mix between breath of the wild  and monster hunter rise  it has the style and presentation of the former  with the addicting gameplay mechanics similar to the latter  this game is a strong 8 10 and i pray that game freak keeps this new formula and expands to it   it would be very disappointing to see them go back to the old style of games after this ',\n",

       "       'if you love pokemon but wanted a fresh take on the series  this will make you happy and give you a lot of meat to chew on  the music  when it s there  is very nice in my opinion  i d describe a lot of it as  mystical  or  dreamlike   the battle themes  however  seem less varied compared to past titles  as i can t recall more than 1 or 2 different themes throughout the main storyline  the main story is more or less typical pokemon filler  meaning it s the bare minimum you would need to call it a story and exists mostly to get you from point a to b  some of the characters have nice designs  and there are ideas and concepts peppered throughout that caught my interest  but all in all the story is in itself quite bland and lifeless  unfortunate  but not surprising  the game does not always look great  or even good  in terms of graphics  if you expected something that s consistently beautiful and polished  you ll be let down  the bulk of my reasoning for an 8 10 review score is the gameplay  which  depending on what you enjoy doing in open world style games  will either make or break the game for you  the alpha pokemon  the new battle  catching system  and the exploration and gathering crafting all scratch an itch for me  it feels fluid  fun  and satisfying to wander around doing these things in tandem  while the world itself is on the empty side and leaves much to be desired  there s enough out there to keep me wanting to explore  the pokedex research will put off some people who are more into the series for the competitive aspects  there is a lot of it and it is required up to a certain point  for people like myself who like to relax and wander without worrying too much about building a top tier smogon team and plowing through the battle tower  it s not going to deter me from enjoying the more laid back aspects of the game  arceus legends is a very important and positive step forward in the series  if they choose to keep going this way and learn from their mistakes  they could very easily create not only the best pokemon game ever one day  but one of the best open world games ever one day  they re far from that point with legends  but i ve enjoyed it immensely as a pokemon fan of more than 20 years ',\n",
       "       'simultaneously the best and most embarassing thing gamefreak has ever released  a fantastic 10 10 game bundled in a very obviously underdeveloped package  the pokémon models and animations look great  but the world itself looks like an early progress shot i would see an indie game dev share on twitter  it s laughable how bad the game looks in some areas  especially most caves and in dark areas  where the background will literally warp around your character like you re poorly greenscreened in   i have many other gripes  such as the story pacing  a lot of dialogue scenes either need to be cut shorter or be more interesting  voice acting would ve helped   but otherwise the game is honestly fantastic  my favourite pokémon experience to date  i just wish it came out like a year later so it would have all the development time it needed  i would love this style of game to continue and be iterated on  it s a major improvement over the old formula  having a game like this with more settlememts to explore and more complex side quests  etc would be a dream  also thank god that they only released one version ',\n",
       "       'this was a necessary experiment for the pokémon franchise  and it was executed fairly well  most importantly  i think it laid a solid foundation for future sequels that will build on the formula  the game focuses entirely on the single player experience  which is where it differs the most from other games in the series  so there is no battling other human players  and minimal interaction with others  and this is entirely by design  the game serves as a prequel to the pokémon franchise  so the areas you explore are very empty due to them being underdeveloped  this definitely gives the series a long desired sense of exploration and adventure  i m not a huge fan of pokémon games  i played several of them  but skipped out on others if i just wasn t in the mood  that formula has not changed in 25 years  so this a very welcome change of pace  while still keeping the core spirit of the pokémon universe  the gameplay loop feels much like  early  pokémon go  where the main objective is just to explore and catch all of the pokémon  it s a pleasant game to explore  however the gameplay loop does get a little repetitive so i found myself taking a lot of breaks  but i would i regularly return to it  it has that breath of the wild atmosphere which is very relaxing   minimal music in the wild  only ambient nature noises  the music is all very soft piano  and vast open spaces  i also appreciate that they added some substance to the story  granted it s nothing to go crazy about  but it provides a welcome change of pace to  beat all the gym leaders and get their badges to become the best  that we have been provided for the past 25 years  the graphics aren t as bad as people make them out to be  but they definitely aren t impressive  i almost feel like if they weren t able to do high quality graphics  whether it s cartoon or realistic  the game would have looked better with some degree of artistic design   maybe watercolor impressions  or anything really  because the graphics do damper the sense of exploration a little bit  overall it s a fun game i can see myself taking my time to play through because it s just a relaxing experience  everything is solid  the effort is exceptional  but it laid that groundwork for future sequels which can truly be fantastic games  i can definitely tell you this is far more exciting than any possible new generation of pokémon they could introduce  and probably one of the most memorable pokémon experiences in the last 15 years ',\n",
       "       'i had rock bottom expectations for this game up until the leaks if we re being honest here  if you ever plan on playing buying this game  do not watch anything nintendo or pokémon put out before the release date because the marketing did such a terrible job selling this game  but given game freak s track record of the last decade  i m shocked they were able to pull this off  being a pokémon fan in the last decade has been rough  oras was awesome   sun moon were good too despite repeated playthroughs making me sour on them a lot  but everything else has been just short of a trainwreck  gen 6 was the definition of lazy repetition aside from bringing everything to 3d  us um was the laziest rerelease i think of all time  the let s go games were yet another unnecessary remake of the awful   boring gen 1  we all know how bad sword   shield were despite their dlcs doing it a slight bit of justice   bdsp finally showed a lot of fans how much passion for this series has been lost by falling flat on their faces trying to  remake  their best games  they re more of a remaster than a remake  but let s get into it  legends arceus is a fantastic game   it s the breath of fresh air that we ve needed for years now  i might just have recent bias now but i wouldn t mind if they didn t make a main series game for a long time if it meant more games like legends  negatives first  the elephant in the room since this game got revealed were the god awful graphics   i can say they definitely touched it up quite a bit since then  but it still just looks plain bad  like i m playing a ps2 game in 2022  yikes  immersion breaking graphics in your billion dollar franchise is inexcusable when this console has given us breath of the wild   mario odyssey  learn how to optimize your games already  there s no reason that every previous switch pokémon game looks better than this one  the pop in is so bad too  sometimes things just spawn right behind you or in front of you as you re running around   it can get annoying when you want to catch a rare pokémon that s been giving you the slip  also the button layout is really weird in legends  to the point that almost 40 hours in i m still hitting the wrong buttons when trying to open the map or open the bag to heal my pokémon  why is y dodge   also made my hands cramp up a lot after long play sessions  please put out a patch where we can change the button layout  the braviary flying feature needs work too  why is there no accent button   having to take back off again   again after slowly landing in these huge open areas is so  dumb  i think the biggest flaw aside from optimization is the lack of any voice acting  it was awkward in more recent games but never as awkward as in legends  this game truly needed it  so many of the big story moments deserved more than a text box with that annoying ass boom sound effect but there s also so much this game does right  catching pokémon   completing the pokédex has never felt better   will never feel the same in the slow mainline games ever again after this  despite some pokémon being annoyances to get  at least i didn t have to shell out an extra  60 for a 2nd identical version just for 10 pokémon they didn t put in my game lol  the new boss battles are incredible too  actually fighting a pokémon on foot  i swear i had fever dreams about a game like this when i was a kid  i feel like the only person who didn t black out during the story  returnal has conditioned my reflexes to dodge effortlessly i guess  the wide open areas are all distinct   a ton of fun to explore  i actually really loved the wild areas in sword   shield so knowing this is what they had up their sleeve  bravo  just wishing they looked like a 2022 game  the story  in true pokémon fashion  is very lowkey up until the end as always  but this time i actually felt something  i was hurt  i was stunned at the stakes the story established    the whole time i was filled with nostalgia feeling like a kid again  impeccable line to walk there   that deserves a lot of praise  just talking   thinking about it fills me with a childlike joy that has been gone for so long with pokémon  it s even got a fair bit of challenge in the new pretty good battle system  who woulda thought  of course a lot of these positives have small quirks i didn t jive with 100  of the time  but legends arceus is an amazing foundation to build sequels off of that will  hopefully  perfect it s formula  at the end of the day  the damage previous games have done to my love   trust of game freak   pokémon may never go away  but this game has done the impossible of giving me hope for the franchise again  i truly think this is a turning point for the franchise   i hope they go full speed ahead   never look back  8 5 10',\n",
       "       'i was very skeptical about legends arceus leading up to its launch  i was nervous that the new formula would be innovative and unique but would ultimately leave a lot to be desired  i was actually pleasantly surprised with what gamefreak delivered  this is the first pokemon game created in a style that is vastly different from previous titles and maintained the pokemon  feel  while making sweeping changes to the overall gameplay loop pros  very fresh take on the formula  more action based gameplay  sacrifices very little in terms of staple game mechanics  good pokedex selection  a catching mechanic that stokes envy from the lets go games  varying and noticeable size differences in the pokemon that makes each catch that much more unique  a serviceable plot  much more streamlined  competitive  building of pokemon that only requires a pokemon to be fed certain items  decent post game content  being able to summon all your pokemon at once in order to chill  interact with them  interesting options for traversal  new pokemon forms to play with  decent in game economy encourages catching pokemon and collecting items  and enraged pokemon are huge and fun to capture cons  not having multiplayer is a shame given how fun the single player content is  the levels are large but there s not a whole lot to see in them  the appeal of the  open world  wears off towards the end of the game when all traversal mechanics are unlocked  the graphics aren t that great  not enough trainer battles  in my opinion the new pokemon forms are pretty ugly design wise  decidueye  except for a few  arcanine  typhlosion   and  again in my opinion  the boss pokemon catching minigame could have been much more fleshed out   it just wasn t that interesting and felt a bit tacked on to me but i feel it is a step in the right direction i had loads of fun playing arceus and was genuinely thankful that gamefreak not only shook up the formula immensely but managed to get so many things right on the first try  none of the cons i listed above stopped me from enjoying the game from start to finish  its far from a perfect experience  but it is an experience that gets me very excited for future  legends  titles ',\n",

       "       'been playing pokémon since platinum and been through quite a bit of burn out from the last couple of games so how does legends hold up many will ask  let s get the big downside done first the lack of art direction i personally don t mind lower graphics but this whole experience could of been more stylized like mhst2 or a game i picked up recently to play nino kuni which is a pretty old game it came out on the playstation 3 and is on switch but holds up because of it s art direction  second issue i ve had is mostly the no abilities and held items on the pokémon help differentiate pokémon from each other in battle and because i like a few layers of complexity specially in turn based jrpgs now we re past the bad first can i can say is this is the most fun i ve ever had catching pokémon as the game allows you to engage them in a few different ways  stealth is the first option and the method of my choice getting in the bonus from throwing the ball at their back is very satisfying  you can take the pokémon head on in battle if you want but most pokémon will run early game so for those who run start the battle back throwing your pokémon at them from behind fun the stun  filling out the dex i thought was gonna be tedious but it s fun as you gotta engage with a few different aspects of the the game you can catch them to level up your research level of said pokémon  give them berries  find ones of different weight size  evolve  defeat them  battle with them to see them perform moves also yes it ll count if you use them yourself in battle  and stealth catching them can also add to the research levels  also exploring the open zones finding pokémon is great specially when you find a rare encounter you didn t see the first time going through the area  pro tip heavy balls early game are your friend but you gotta get close but it s worth specially for catching alpha pokémon as they give a seed of mastery you can use to master a move back in town to use heavy or agile style with said move  great exp for the team  and a good chunk of money finally money which you ll need to upgrading your inventory size onto the story and characters without any spoilers they are pretty good specially by pokémon standards  as usual pokémon has very visually striking characters and they have great personalities  too bad there is no voice acting which feels like the next step for pokémon to go with their game as i have a tendency to speed read without voice acting and then kinda forget a little what is said after the fact but that s me  but overall i think the story probably is the best i ve seen out of pokémon black and white in conclusion  i believe this game is great with all the ways you can engage with catching and filling your pokédex  the technical limitations show very heavily but the pokémon themselves are full of life and personality with how they are animated hopefully in the future these kind of games are allowed more time to bake in oven with a more solid art direction  story and characters are great but still voice acting feels like it would do wonderfully in a series like this adding to the charming characters  overall this game is an 8 10 if they continue with this formula for older audiences that ll be a win',\n",

       "       'this game is one of the most important entries that the pokémon company has ever done  thankfully  this game delivers an experience that many pokémon fans have been waiting for years  however there are small flaws or annoyances that keep it from being the ultimate experience for a pokémon man let s start out with some flaws  the game doesn t look at its best even for nintendo switch standards  everything seems to just be a lack of polish or detail  but that doesn t mean that the graphics are always bad  just to the point where it starts to get distracting and sticks out  the fixed camera when first entering a battle or talking to an npc can either clip through or be completely obstructed by an object   thankfully in pokémon battles you can move around the battlefield  one more thing is that through the three noble pokémon battles that i have completed  which serve as the boss battles of the game  they all feel like dodge and throw  with no real gameplay depth outside of it  you can send out pokémon when the noble pokémon is stunned  but you can completely ignore this message and keep on throwing balms and win without sending out a single pokémon  that s it on the flaws  i might edit this review if i encounter more problems or good things about the game  now for the good things  first of  this is a complete shift from the traditional pokémon formula  there is no gym battles  elite four  or any league to become champion of  your job is to research pokémon and create the region s first pokédex  i feel this gameplay can make or break some peoples interest to buy this game  but  i encourage pokémon fans to give this a try for themselves to see if this is the style of gameplay they enjoy to play  the gameplay is about catching and researching pokémon in which the objectives can vary between defeating the pokémon with certain moves  feeding it berries  seeing it use moves  or just straight up catching it  alpha pokémon can also appear around the map and will always be tens of levels above your party  pokémon can also deal damage to you  the player causing you to faint and lose some items if you take too much damage  i love the animations of the pokémon  because they were able to focus on a smaller pool of pokémon and actually delivering on that promise   let s not talk about swsh  pokémon battles have also increased the freedom of the player  now after a battle starts  you are freely able to move around the battlefield and look around with different viewing angles  a new mechanic is added with agile and strong styles of moves  agile moves decrease the power of the move and give your pokémon more likely chance of getting their next move soon  strong style is the opposite  increasing power and less likely chance of getting the next move sooner  this does give an extra layer of strategy and also scraps the idea of alternating moves  you can and will get two turns in succession or take two moves from an opponent in a row  side quests can be lackluster but be a good thing to do when you don t want to progress the story  speaking of the story  i really can t judge the story based on my opinions because of my style of gameplay  but when i can say is that there is more dialogue and a lot more cutscenes than a regular pokémon game  all in all  i support the gameplay direction that gamefreak is trying to do and hopefully this can be a regular occurring series and that some of the ideas will be implemented into gen 9 and beyond  i am a big pokémon fan and i hope that gamefreak will finally turn around the quality of games that have been released these last few years ',\n",
       "       'some reviews for this game baffle me  decided to post my own because some of the reviews here make the game seem better worse than it is  claim things that are straight up wrong and some of them aren t even reviews  but just rants against the fans developers  half of them also give me the feeling that the writer didn t even play the game 8 10 from me  the game actually shakes things up when compared to previous pokemon games  the new gameplay formula is actually fresh and interesting this game revolves mainly around building the first pokedex of the location where the game takes place  the hisui region  in previous games  filling up the pokedex was done simply by catching a pokemon  and the whole page for this pokemon would be filled up immediatly  that is not the case here  catching a pokemon will only get you so far in this case  despite what some others claim here  to fill out the rest of a pokemons dex entry  you ll need to interact with this pokemon in a variety of ways  catching and battling are obvious  but there s more to it  seeing it use certain moves  evolving it  finding different forms genders  feeding it  and so on  all of this will get you closer towards a complete dex entry  thankfully  you don t have to do every task to fill an entry when compared to previous installments  the total number of pokemon in this game is lower than usual  there are a total of 242 pokemon in this game  some may say this lazy on game freaks end  but i personally think that this is fine  filling out the pokedex would be a nightmare to do if there were a lot of pokemon  which is a problem since that is the main focus here  also  again despite what others may claim  there are plenty of new animations present for each pokemon  so having a lower amount seems fair  every pokemon also has their own personality in the wild  this pokedex and catching focused approach makes for a fun gameplay cycle speaking of the wild  this game isn t just your standard pokemon rpg  there are 5 big  open maps for you to explore  each of which are unique  they are well designed  exploration is rewarded with collectibles  items and pokemon  but not mandatory  catching pokemon is handled differently here too  you can do it the standard way by battling them and weakening them  but you also have the option to catch them outside of battle  you may want to take a different approach depending on the pokemon you re after  some are docile  some are hostile  and some are easily scared  you can choose to sneak up on a pokemon using the environment around you  or lure them out with food  if you are being attacked  you have to dodge their attacks  initiate a battle  or throw objects at them to stun them  the new types of pokeballs complement this system well the battle system has also seen some changes  specifically the new attacking styles and turn system  the turn system was previously just done with the speed stat deciding who goes first  but now the speed stat is more important  a high speed can give your pokemon multiple turns back to back  but this also applies to the opponent  the new attacking styles also impact this  as a strong style move makes you slower but more powerful  while an agile style move does the opposite  both styles also take more pp than a normal move  you can also walk around during these battles  but this doesn t have much of an impact on anything  some battles will even have you outnumbered against multiple pokemon at once due to the setting story of the game  trainers aren t very common  but they are present  gyms leaders aren t here  and have been replaced by the noble pokemon  these are essentially the bosses of the game  and have you battling them unlike any regular pokemon i m sure you ve seen this plenty of times  but graphically  the game is sub par  the main issue seems to be muddy and low res textures  bland lighting  lack of shadows and reflections  and some performance related issues  render distance of objects and the framerate of npc s pokemon   graphics don t mean everything but in this case it s all very noticable and should ve been better  the game runs fine at 30 fps overall  with a few stutters here and there  music sound design however is some good stuff  but this has always been a stronger point for this series i m no expert on stories but what s here is fine  it s pretty interesting  mainly due to the setting  first two or so hours are pretty dialogue heavy due to tutorials and whatnot and could ve been a bit less quality of life improvements are definitely present  the best change here is probably a better gameplay flow thanks to the better menu design  and less menu s in general overal  a big step and a fresh take on pokemon  a new approach to gameplay and a fun cycle keeps me invested  with quality of life improvements everywhere  graphically sub par  bur story and sound design are fine  interested to see where pokemon goes after this  i d say it s worth full price ',\n",

       "       'the standards for pokemon games is at an all time low  while legends arceus is by no means bad  it continues the trend of a barebones game that feels immediately outdated in a franchise that just doesn t seem to grow  it s a backwards step  maybe a reduction of the formula to set a new foundation for later games  but it s just a bit too late for me  the world isn t an enjoyment to traverse  it s hindered by being visually underwhelming  but it just lacks a sense of activity  the pokemon exist only for the player  they don t interact with the world in any meaningful way  they re just collectibles  in the past  this wasn t as big of a problem because creating a team to conquer the league was always your goal  here  the pokemon are the only real goal  yet  they just linger as mostly aggressive or timid creatures not really displaying much if their nature or showing character  maybe you re now thinking i expect too much  and yes  i do  i expect a lot from one of the most successful franchises of my lifetime  considering other titles in the franchise have had features that would be suitable here  but as is the trend with pokemon games  we lose 3 features and gain 1  and yet  here we are  with one of the most well received games in the franchise in a while  if only  it seems  because the game is just about good enough  is it a step in the right direction  absolutely  is it a good pokemon game  sure  in a vacuum of just pokemon games it may be one of the best  but i m of the opinion it should be better  call it entitled  but having supported the franchise since the first iteration  i do think the fanbase deserves a game of much higher quality  which now leaves us in the position we re all in  we want to support the good parts of the franchise in hopes we get better versions of that  but the excitement and initial highly positive reaction from just getting something that isn t a disappointment means the quality of this game  which is quite low  is more than enough for a company that just wants to make more money  it s an okay game  it s not bad  but it s not great  and when the honeymoon period wears off  we ll be back to a state of disappointment as we wait for something truly good ',\n",
       "       'i ve completed the 100  of the game last night  i ll always recommend this game to the franchise s fans but not without many criticisms this game changes the game play completely with many long awaited new mechanics that we can only hope will stay in the future games  it s still a major improvement from the past games especially the recent bdsp remakes unfortunately the technical aspects of this title are lacking and may lower the enjoyment of this experience by a lot it s sad to know that your avatar is exploring a forest just because of its name appearing on the top corner and not by the visual environment  it s unsatisfying having many places very similar to one another inside the same map  the art direction is great as always but the immersion is ruined by its lacking we knew of this lacking by the trailer but i would have still granted an 8 out of this game if not for another very disturbing aspect  the writing in this game is a new low  pokémon had always had childish writing but in this instance every other dialog contradicts the one before  we are in a time where pokémon are feared but 50  of the village population is from a well established region where they already have pokéride  hm and are living peacefully with the pokémon  we are told that no one knows how to capture pokémon then they explain to us how to do so  they told us we are the greater battler but we have a teacher for that way more skilled than us  we are told that all the pokémon are fearsome then we are shown other character knowing that there are many species that are very peaceful toward them and easy to catch or to live with i know this game is mostly for children but i would love to have a game not contradicting itself so often the combat mechanics are an improvement but they need some fixing especially while battling other trainers  if you build  like me  a slow team it might occur that when one member is ko the next one entering will have to wait 2 3 moves from the opponent resulting in another ko without being able to do anything  in late game i had to rethink my team because one trainer attacked 13 times in a row demolishing my team  this is not a rise in the difficulty but some design flaw since i might want to play with my favorite pokémon without having such a disadvantage and all slower pokémon fill penalized over all the game is a good one and the game play loop in enjoyable  if they keep working on their optimizations skills and fix up the few problem this game could be a new starting point for the brand ',\n",
       "       'i really enjoy playing this game and it s cool because this is what all pokemon players ever wanted but 1  why no one have voice in this game 2  needs more anti aliasing when playing docked3  need more character animations for some choices in game  like pressing a stone button instead of chat selections 4  need a better way to track side quests and track pokemon progressionsometimes i feel the dev team had some lazy decisions about some aspects of the game but in the end it s a good refresh for the pokemon game franchise and i expect more on the next games like online coop  battle arenas and more',\n",
       "       'finally the franchise go out of its old classic gamestyle  compared with other jrpg nothing looks increadible but pokemon charm is very strong from technical point of view pla looks like 2002 game with worst art direction ',\n",
       "       'i ve played about 40 hours of legends  arceus  it s a good game  is there a lot that could ve been done better  absolutely  are there some things they should ve expanded upon  yes  is it a step in the right direction though  certainly the gameplay is arguably the most important aspect of a game  and i am happy to say that what legends  arceus provided is strangely satisfying  when looking at trailers  you may be concerned that the environments have nothing to really explore  this is somewhat true  the terrain can be a bit dull at times  but there are also times where you ll find yourself wandering into this hidden corner of the map  and you ll be rewarded by various things  even when the terrain isn t too interesting  you ll find that the pokemon and items you pick up will make up for it  when it comes to the requests  it can be a bit mixed  some will be really interesting  slightly comedic in an almost pokemon anime fashion  or wield some cool rewards  others  however  will just leave you looking up how to complete it on your phone due to it just being a boring scavenger hunt  i don t mind having to look for stuff  but i think some hints that would narrow down where to search would ve made the experience a lot better  the battles with noble pokemon can be surprisingly difficult  and has a very consistent difficulty curve  the only one i have issues with is in the cobalt coastlands  and that s mostly because the arena makes it feel like you re fluffing your way through it until you finally manage to somehow beat it  it was still fun  but it could ve been better  the one in the alabaster icelands has to be my favorite  it s hard  but it s a fun type of hard  the trainer battles are  for lack of a better description  interesting  at the beginning of the story  it s very basic  and comparable to sword and shield s battling  by the time you get to the post game though  it leans more towards the  almost unfair  territory you d expect from cynthia in platinum  and arguably beyond that  the battling itself has changed a lot in this game  and my feelings on it are a bit mixed  on one side  it adds a bit of strategy that was appreciated  on the other side  it can seem a bit unfair and annoying  especially when some pokemon out speed you right out the gate  the new status effects are actually pretty cool  and i wouldn t mind if they were implemented into generation 9  the crafting is also a nice touch  and surprisingly well balanced  overall i give gameplay an 8 10 the story is fairly average  until you get to the post game  a lot of it feels like it could ve gone deeper  or been explained with less presses of the  a  button  i think two things that game freak should learn in the future is to show rather than tell  and to not repeat a single point several times  it s better than it was in sword and shield  but it still needs some work  the last plot point in the post game was definitely worth it though  the story is a 7 10 for me do not expect the best in legend  arceus  graphics and animation  some terrain from far away can look downright ugly  and not properly portray what s actually out there  for instance  if you look at the heartwood from the heights base camp  almost all of the trees are nonexistent  the anti aliasing can also be really weird at times  especially around water  the animations department is actually a bit better in comparison  it isn t quite monster hunter levels  but most of the animations are good enough to keep you immersed  there are times  mostly while doing requests  where it s somewhat obvious that they took some shortcuts  but it s nowhere near as bad as sword and shield  5 10 for graphics and animations the music is one of legends  arceus  high points  it s blissful when you go into the heartwood or traverse the lands at night  because the music just brings you in  sometimes you don t want to battle pokemon just so you can hear some of these tracks without interruption  there are two tracks that play in the cobalt coastlands that takes me out of the mood though   cobalt coastlands 1  and  cobalt coastlands 1  version 2   are references the diamond and pearl s  route 210  track  and while it fits diamond and pearl s tracks  it doesn t really fit the feel you get in the cobalt coastlands  which is a  nice  chill day at the beach  but with a pinch of danger   the music has more of a  sprint to the adventure ahead  sort of feel  there are also times where i felt that the  battle   wild pokémon   track got a bit repetitive  maybe if there were slight variations depending on where you were  that would ve made it a lot better  there was also this one trainer battle that i wish had some more dramatic music to it instead of the normal trainer theme  all of these are nit picks though  and didn t in the way of my enjoyment much  an 8 10 overall  i hope that generation 9 and future legends titles  if there are any  improve upon this and make something truly great  there s promise here ',\n",

       "       'you all probably know what s good about this game already  so i ll go ahead and just list some negatives that have impacted my overall impression of it   subpar graphics  breath of the wild looked way better than this back when it was released  five years ago   low framerate  it s 30 at best  but often far below that   the camera is constantly shifting on its own  and there s no way to make it stay in place   empty world  aside from pokémon wandering around and some farming points  there s nothing else to find anywhere  no trainers  no points of interest  no treasure chests  etc   you can t switch pokémon inbetween turns in battle   story npcs and wild pokémon can fight you using several pokémon at once  but you re stuck using a single one even in those battles  having to go 1 vs 3 isn t uncommon   unless you re fine with wasting precious money to buy poké balls  you ll have to craft your own  this  in turn  means that you ll end up having to farm resources  which is more than a little tedious   to actually add a complete entry for a pokémon in your pokédex  you need to fulfill som criteria  like catching a certain number of that pokémon  defeating a certain number of that pokémon  and so on  it might seem like a fun addition on paper  but being forced to do more or less the same tasks over and over and over again for every single pokémon gets annoying pretty quickly   the  flying mount  isn t actually flying but rather just gliding  making it borderline useless for travel unless you start off on a high plateau   clunky controls while riding mount   even if you re close enough to an enemy to focus on it  that doesn t mean your poké ball will reach it  you ll often be a few inches off  alerting the pokémon to your presence and potentially make it turn aggressive   a lot of pokémon have a very long aggro range  making them impossible to approach unless you sneak up on them from behind   sneaking is extremely slow  so the pokémon you re approaching will most likely have turned around and noticed you by the time you re close enough to actually hit it with a ball   if you re hiding in grass and throw a poké ball that then fails to catch a pokémon  you ll be noticed and probably attacked by that pokémon even if you re still hidden and should be impossible to find   boss fights against frenzied  yellow  pokémon are godawful  the dodge mechanic is clunky at best  and the window of opportunity for sending a pokémon in to fight the boss after it s been injured enough is frustratingly narrow  unless you do it basically the same second the message pops up on screen  the poké ball will just bounce off and the boss will recover  what this means is that you ll usually be stuck slowly whittling away the boss  entire hp with throwable items ',\n",

       "       'pokemon legends  arceus had a great deal of potential leading up to release  but the end product is sadly lacking it s nice to see a major attempt to revitalize the age old formula that s remained largely unchanged since the gameboy  but the execution is muddled  catching pokemon in real time feels great  alongside the overhauled battle system  but the content of arceus is simply too repetitive to be enjoyed in the long term  the open world environments are only really fun to explore the first time around  the variety is really lacking  and the pokedex system requiring multiple captures and interactions with the same creature makes the experience a bit of a slog the style of the game is initially appealing  a game set in the distant past of the sinnoh region is conceptually very compelling  unfortunately  arceus fails to live up to it s premise and it s world and environments tend to be totally without life and character  there s only a single proper town  and there s very little in the way of meaningful interaction here  the graphics are noticeably subpar for an official nintendo release  with plenty of minor visual bugs to distract you from the experience the story is another letdown  as throughout the game s considerable length nothing of note really happens  it s a very basic set of events  but the game can t help itself from including walls upon walls of text  the characters are really not at all memorable  and only serve basic story functions before being left to the wayside  this is a shame  as many of the characters are really well designed  and several represent the ancestors of characters from diamond and pearl  which is a pretty interesting concept  so it s a shame that they feel like such a throwaway element of the experience  although i was initially quite excited to learn about the world legends  arceus takes place in  this enthusiasm quickly fizzled over the game s playtime and the story petered out in a disappointingly obvious and expected way i wish that i could separate the disappointing parts of arceus from it s promising new gameplay formula  but that s simply not possible  the new gameplay style could be a great new direction for the series  but it s simply too repetitive in this current iteration to be compelling past the first few times you experience it  it s also a major letdown to see how utterly lifeless the world  characters  and story are  as these elements had the potential to be legitimately compelling and explore the world of sinnoh in exciting new ways  legends  arceus is probably worth checking out if you re a fan of the series and want to see a new take on the gameplay formula  but don t expect much more than that ',\n",

       "       'this game takes players on an extraordinary adventure in an ancient  japanese themed world of pokemon  where you get the chance to befriend the legendary pokemon arceus  let s hope everyone forgot about pokemon conquest so we can make that sound more original  ok  to be fair   i don t hate this game  i think this a great reimagining of sinnoh  its not the remake i wanted  but i still had a pretty good time  i was hesitate at first  discovering that the final sinnoh remake was going to be a spin off game really disappointed  i mean in let s go  the catching mechanics are vastly different compared to other games but they were easy to learn and its a lot like the original pokemon games where everyone could learn  reflect   but this a whole new pokemon world   brand new catching mechanics and an altered battle system  it s all diverse  and while the battle system is ok at best  i m really impressed with the new catching mechanics  stalking careless pokemon in the tall grass like a true hunter and then smashing them in the back for the capture   its really satisfying  it s definitely the game s biggest strength  this game definitely isn t for battle fans  but it was rather designed for those who love to complete the pokedex  it s a world with no version exclusives and trade items are equivalent evolution stones  nothing s holding you back this time to catch all of those pocket monsters  personally my favorite part of this experience was probably the alpha pokemon  they remind me of some old pokepark memories  only these pokemon aren t pissed off  they want to tear you to shreds  it s so exhilarating trying to catch these guys  they roar so loud that its sends your character flying  the added size and the glowing red eyes really adds to intimidation  it looks a lot like the classic mystery dungeon box art  it s just gives me another reason to love them  they are over leveled and are as strong as most legendaries  which makes it all the more satisfying to build a team out of them  do you know how awesome it is to build a team made of alpha sinnoh starters  it s like a dream come true  and i ll also shout out  the reason i call this is a  reimagined sinnoh  is because if you listen carefully   you can hear remixed level themes from diamond and pearl all across the game  eterna forest  mt  coronet  the works  the celestica flutes sound just like the old title screens  and there s plenty of sinnoh pokemon to set a nice  familiar tone to the game  i like the new pokemon forms fine  but it puts a greater smile on my face to see hundreds of sinnoh pokemon spread across the land  including the platinum entries  yes  move over half asked diamond and pearl remakes   this is how its done  well   for the most part the game is great  even with my half broken controller and a few sprite glitches i was still having a fun ride  but the charm of the characters started to wear off after i defeated avalugg  i bet a lot of people question this part when they back at the game  why the hell does commander kamado kick you out of the village  for some reason  he suddenly accuses you  the child suffering from amnesia  who has been doing nothing but help team galaxy  and save the nobles   for causing the distortion threatening the region of hisui  at this point of the game a lot a scene in the story feel forced  the commander suddenly turns into an antagonist and there s some extra backstory for the charm sisters  and i just don t care  some of the boss fights in this game were annoying and i m not a fan of all the side quests   but those are just nitpicks  an rpg game doesn t need a breathtaking story to be good  but kamado s motivation is childish  it feels like the writers just made his character an antagonist because the first climax wasn t exciting enough  this is just as weak as sword and shield s antagonist  and as for volo as the true villain  i have to ask   did anyone care  the final fight takes place after the main story credits  so most players are likely to miss out on it  its not really built up well and sadly  like the new cynthia in the remakes  the developers make this fight unnecessarily difficult in order to entertain older fans  i like difficult pokemon challenges  but do you really think the battle system was a highlight in this game  the game starts to feel smaller when i started to climb mount coronet  not putting the effort to remake the distortion world  or summit level longer was a huge missed opportunity  i can t listen to the sweet remix if the level one takes a minute to climb  the main gimmicks are a lot more entertaining than the conclusions  the characters are vibrant an dit feels good to build a team of my favorite pokemon  but this game really needs something more if it wants to be remembered  hopefully  the dlc this time around will be worth purchasing  because this is the most fun i ve had with a modern pokemon game in years  i hope that gamefreak will return to greatness someday  one step at a time ',\n",

       "       'i wasn t sure what to make of pl arceus when it was first announced  on the one hand  gf and tpc appeared to be changing up the battle mechanics   adding real time elements  on the other hand  its poor graphics and empty overworld left a lot to be desired  it was also unclear whether the game would be an experimental one off  or an attempt to change evolve the series  core mechanics  as someone who s played since the very first titles but finds the latest entries to be stale and disappointing  i went in with very low expectations pokemon legends  arceus  trailers promised a decent story  and while i can attest that the writing receives more focus than usual  the presentation frankly sucks  as there s still no voice acting  with most interactions consisting of characters awkwardly standing   talking the real draws are the revamped combat and catching systems  the changes to gameplay  while not perfect  make arceus initially far more captivating than its preceding games  first and most importantly  you can aim poke balls to interact directly with pokemon on the field    while exploring  you ll be able to easily shuffle who s next in line to battle  as well as send them to harvest materials from trees  shrubs  and mineral outcroppings  essential for crafting healing items and poke balls many pokemon will either run or attack your avatar on sight  so you ve got options   dodge like it s dark souls  sneak around and try to nab them without being spotted  ambush with your pokemon to start a fight  lure repel them with food  or run away  you ll also get multiple pokemon mounts to ride across the game s several open areas combat is tweaked in many minor ways  while you ll be dodging occasionally  aside from bosses  you don t fight pokemon in real time  so the traditional four move  turn based core combat remains  the game introduces agile and strong variations to attacks  faster and weaker vs stronger and slower   best of all  your pokemon s moves can now be easily switched outside of battle  making it infinitely more convenient to swap movesets  it really opens up a lot of possibilities   you can have your starter be a sweeper in one battle  and a defensive mon catching tool in the next  held items no longer exist  status effects are tweaked  with most being weaker  and they thankfully disappear after each battle these changes  as well as the limited pool of teachable moves  make certain builds  such as dedicated physical and special sweepers  far more effective  it ll be in your interest to get battles done as quickly as possible  especially since you ll often find yourself fighting multiple wild pokemon at once with just one of your own  for the most part  the changes also help the game to flow smoother  since you ll be covering a lot of ground in the great outdoors  often atop mounted pokemon  however  due to the kneecapping of potential builds owing to the removal of breeding  and lack of variety in your foes making fine tuning an afterthought  i grew bored of the battles halfway in there are no gyms  no breeding  and very few trainer battles  instead  you ll spend time gathering crafting  and on the pokedex  this time your dex entries don t end with just catching and trading  you re also tasked with specific battle tasks  you ll only need to fulfill ten challenges per pokemon  so while it isn t daunting  it does feel like busywork that brings me to the game s biggest weakness   the world itself   and i don t just mean the fact that there are limited ways to interact with the environments  or that the 242 pokemon are a mixed bag of species  while the pokemon models are often well animated  the day night and weather cycles add variety  and the game runs smoothly with minimal loading  there s no sugarcoating the fact that the graphics and environments are subpar  featuring empty worlds  trees   textures that would look bad on the gamecube  pop in and heavy aliasing    a bland color palette tempered by muted art direction it s a testament to the strength of arceus  core mechanics that the bland environments  lack of trainer battles  and unfinished feel of the game don t completely sink the experience  perhaps it s because my expectations were so low going in  but i can safely say that in spite of its many faults  arceus is the most fun i ve had with a pokemon title since the days of the ds  it also shows that the franchise in general still has potential  that may sound like faint praise from someone who has been critical of the mainline franchise for years  but i think most fans will appreciate the real time elements  the easily swappable movesets  and the additions to the world building and lore  my only hope is that nintendo is able to build upon what was established in this title and utilize it to take the franchise forward in a bold new direction  rated 4 10 to balance out all the shills ',\n",

       "       'pokemon legends was an extreme disappointment for me  i was super hyped for this game as a lifelong pokemon fan  but also as an rpg fan  this game fell short of my expectations in several different categories firstly  the combat feels horrible to me  they revamped the stats and combat system for pokemon legends  but it doesn t feel good  every move hits so hard  and you will often lose several pokemon battling a wild pokemon  you will almost always lose a few when fighting an alpha pokemon or a noble pokemon  a lot of people seem to think this makes the game more challenging  but to me it just made it more frustrating  i still never blacked out or lost my entire party  i just had to craft a boatload of revives and potions after each fight in addition to this  they removed abilities from the game and instead added  agile  and  strong  style moves  you can use agile to perform and weaker attack  or strong for the opposite  while this seems cool in theory  battles rarely ever last long enough to reward using agile style  i personally feel like abilities made pokemon more unique and provided for a more interesting combat experience  overall  i tried to avoid encounters with wild pokemon and catch them without entering combat if possible secondly  the story blows  one of the main appeals to most rpgs is their stories  the witcher  skyrim  horizon zero dawn  etc  all have deep stories with plenty of twists and turns that keep you engaged  the story in pokemon legends is extremely vague and offers very little conclusion even upon full completion  you re basically a kid who fell through a space time distortion into ancient sinnoh where pokemon are going crazy  upon completion of the story and the entire pokedex  you still haven t figured out who you are and why you fell through the space time rift to begin with third  calling this an  open world rpg  is laughable  the game is extremely linear and you are bound to certain areas until you complete the main quest  this isn t like skyrim  fallout  or breath of the wild where you can freely go where you please and complete the story how you like  there are no meaningful choices involved at all  you can explore the areas you ve unlocked to your heart s content  but there aren t really any side stories or anything  the world is bland and lacks depth  there aren t any cool puzzles or hidden areas to discover  ultimately  this just felt like a different take on the existing pokemon games  it certainly didn t feel like the revolutionary open world rpg that it was hyped up to be lastly  i tried not to judge this game too harshly off of graphics and performance  but unfortunately  it is impossible to overlook that aspect of the game  this game plays and looks worse than skyrim  a 2011 game  there are fps drops that make the game laggy and feel bad regardless of whether you play handheld or docked  i know the switch isn t a very powerful system  but it sure ran breath of the wild a heck of a lot better overalll  i think pokemon legends is a cool idea with awful execution  while it was enjoyable at times  especially in the beginning  doing the same thing over and over got old pretty fast  this game feels close to being something awesome but falls short in way too many crucial areas for me to warrant giving it more than a 3 or a 4 at best  unfortunately  due to the shockingly good reviews this game has gotten so far  i don t think game freak or tpc will make efforts to improve on these areas in the future  and pokemon will continue to go downhill as a franchise ',\n",

       "       'it s fun in the short term  but it doesn t have much in the way of replayability  or even story despite the fact that it s supposed to be narrative driven  most of the game is catching pokémon until it s time for you to do the same repetitive task of calming the angry lord pokémon  pokémon is no stranger to repetition  but it s less challenging than the pokémon gyms in previous games  those at least had a few trainers each  different puzzles to solve  and gym leaders weren t hard to beat  but if you weren t prepared you could lose or just barely win  the lord pokémon are much easier to beat than gym leaders  and it s a much more tedious task  you just throw balm  battle  throw balm  battle again  and throw balms  or you can skip the battles completely and just throw balms  even dialga and palkia can be cheesed by just throwing balms  and they re some of the final bosses of the game  there s a huge lack of trainer battles in the game  you re lucky to see one every half hour  i d say it s closer to one an hour unless you re at the few segments in the game where you re forced into back to back battles  there s no post game facility like virtually every other main series game after crystal  and there are about 240 pokémon  so very few to choose from in regards to team building  on subsequent playthroughs if you can actually bring yourself to replay the game you ll likely end up using the same pokémon because there are so few encountered in the first 5 or so areas  there are a decent number of side quests  or  requests  as the game calls them to differentiate from the main quests or  missions    but most of them are simple fetch quests  bring an npc x number of y item s   show them a certain pokémon or pokédex entry  etc  and there s virtually no multiplayer besides trading  despite every other main series game having player vs player battles which never detracted from the single player experience  the world is also full of barren fields or mountains that have maybe 2 or 3 pokémon on screen at best 99  of the time  which is inexcusable because the areas are relatively small compared to other open world games  i m using that term loosely for this game   other games of this nature you ll find settlements or structures with characters who will give you quests or you can explore a dungeon  no such luck here  you ll just keep walking seeing the same pokémon and plants over and over again the game is mediocre at best  bad but not terrible at worst  i know bad games  because i ve played the two worlds games and sonic  06 i really wanted to like the game and hoped it would be good  but i was thoroughly let down  pokémon sword and shield and pokémon brilliant diamond and shining pearl are miles ahead of this game in terms of content  replayability  and following the concept of the series as a whole ',\n",

       "       'pokemon legends  arceus is more of a tech demo that experiences with new mechanics and quality of life features for the pokemon franchise than it is a fully fledged aaa title pla s main draw is that it attempts to shakeup the pokemon formula by modernizing the pokemon experience to more closely match what pokemon catching would be like in the real world and how it is depicted in the anime series there is clearly some effort put forth here in executing this new formula  but just like almost every other recent iteration of pokemon  there are obvious signs of neglect and corner cutting the most obvious signs of neglect come from its lackluster visuals  graphics aren t everything sure  but in a semi open world game where exploring the environment and catching pokemon is the main draw  how the world looks is an important aspect of the overall experience not only are the graphics sub par when compared to other titles on the same console  it doesn t even match the graphical quality of games from 5  years ago now  if sub par graphics are used to make up for hinderances due to performance that can be more understandable but that is not the case here pla has much less taking place on screen at any given time than many other open world games and it s also not technically an open world game as each individual area you explore is a restricted sub set of the overall world based on what mission objective is chosen from the  town hub  which is also the only town you ll be visiting given the restrictive nature of the  open world  and its sub par graphics  it could still look better if simply more was taking place on screen  for example  if there were more trees  more grass  more pokemon  etc  even if the textures looked the way they do  there would be better immersion overall instead  we get poor graphics  a limited world  and barren empty environments  all of that being said  this unfortunately doesn t equate to better performance  the game still suffers from performance issues and pop in aside from visuals and performance  the game itself has a repetitive gameplay loop there are no dungeons in pla  no real puzzles  no interesting caves  there are pokemon and there are more pokemon and your only job is to throw balls at them and or fight them not having ivs evs  breeding  competitive battling  held items etc  removes a huge aspect of replay ability and purpose from the game not having any interesting  nice looking environments to explore  no puzzles  and no real challenges aside from making your character roll to the side make this overall experience very lack luster some would probably say that only  hardcore pokemon fans  would like this game but i disagree  i think there are plenty of hardcore pokemon fans who simply recognize this games flaws and are able to acknowledge this is not the definitive edition of pokemon or what we all wanted if you like simply catching pokemon  reading lots of dialogue  exploring empty worlds  not having any real motivation or purpose aside from completing checklists  then you ll likely enjoy this game for everyone else  you re going to be disappointed  i would assume though that the majority of the more critical gamers and pokemon fans already know this i give gamefreak credit for trying something new but this is not the kind of pokemon experience i ultimately wanted  it s scratching the surface  it s getting there so to speak  but it s still lacking a lot of charm and polish given that this game has  i believe  only been developed for roughly a year or so  what they ve managed to achieve in that time isn t bad necessarily but to call this a aaa nintendo switch title and to charge full price for it is disappointing again  if going back on the visuals and limiting the explorable world to small sub sets at a time were for performance reasons  they didn t achieve their goal the world is a bland  uneventful  empty  barren place  there are pokemon in it so  there s that but after you hide in a bush a few times  dodge roll some attacks  and throw a few pokeballs around  you ve literally experienced the entirety of this game there is a story sure  but it s somewhat irrelevant and is largely just tedious and not immersive enough given the state the rest of the game is in now maybe gamefreak will be able to use this  tech demo  as a starting point to create future titles and maybe in doing so we can expect hope for more polish in the future but the point here is that pla doesn t really add all that much to the pokemon franchise and the overall experience it offers is very lackluster and generic i think part of the reason pla is getting as much praise as it has is due to the fact that pokemon fans are literally starving for innovation  coming from the 1 1 remake that is brilliant diamond and shining pearl  it makes pla look revolutionary dodge rolling and open world exploration are not new ideas ',\n",

       "       'i honestly really disliked legends of arceus  and i think i m just done with mainline pokémon for a while  aside from the technical issues that we all knew would be coming  the game just isn t fun  the catching got really boring for me after a while  the weaker mons just went in and it felt like a chore to battle everything else  at some point it felt like  why am i just fighting these pokémon  there s no reason my ultra or great balls shouldn t just be able to deal with this   which left me wondering why i was bothering to even engage in the dex the game is also horribly unbalanced  with your ability to catch alpha pokémon  if you catch one then you basically sweep till the next power up  then you sweep again  rinse and repeat  the alpha pokémon are so far ahead of everybody and everyone else it makes the game a massive breeze  sure you can self inflict rules to not catch them  but honestly  it shouldn t have even been an option  the mons offer good enough rewards defeating them  they should have been uncatchable mini bosses the pokedex honestly feels like padding  i m glad its more involved  don t get me wrong  its an improvement  but the option to go further than research level 10 is nothing more than an excuse to get you to play the game more  it doesn t offer anything substantial and nothing you can t get going well below research level 10 on every pokémon in a given zone  now instead of simply completing the dex  the player for true completion must watch a magicarp use splash 100 times  watch the tackle  ember  fire wheel  and almost every other move s animation dozens if not hundreds of times  you must catch every pokémon a minimum of 15 25 times  for many more because you need to catch them while they re unaware of you  watch pokémon eat food who knows how many times  beat pokémon with a certain type of move a ton of times  which adds to the problem of seeing repeated animations  and this is far worse than other pokémon games because you can t disable battle animations  and its required to beat the game the world is probably the worst part of the game  i m not talking about the look  although i also dislike the art style   but the actual play world is just bad  its so empty  there is nothing to do in each zone other than catch pokémon  nothing to look at other than mt  coronet  nothing in the world to interact with that s fun  there should be more to do than resource gather or catch  i want to have fun things to do while i m engaging in the main game  it feels like a parred down version of what it could and honestly should be  every zone feels the same  while yes  one zone is swampy  another is cold  and one is the sea  they feel the same to explore  the only reason i remember differences between the zones is because its so fresh in my mind  in a few months its going to all blend together  if i recall correctly  there was a pathway in the first zone that went up and to the left  might have been the 3rd   and that reappeared in the snowy zone  not a pathway going up and to the left  the exact same pathway  it had the same side  same slope  same geometry  same everything the art also looks bad  i don t mean graphically  i don t care how it looks graphically  i mean the art style  the game is bland  boring  and really uninspired  its clear they were trying for ancient japanese art  but it doesn t translate to the game at all  compared to other games on the swtich with more inventive art styles  and other pokémon games like unite or xd tournament  the game just feels like a smear of brown with some green and blue mixed in  the fan made stuff looks better than the actual game  i honestly think it should have looked like the end of the reveal trailer  that would have been fantastic the characters are all also super bland  its the same issue with the zones  in a few months  they re going to blend together again  i m not expecting a story or characters in pokémon akin to xenoblade  but i am expecting something more  especially since this pokémon game is the most story and character driven game since gen 5  i can honestly say i will remember gen 6 characters better than these ones  and its because they had distinctive designs the game did improve on the pc  mass release   moves  seeing the true size of pokémon on the overworld  and evolutions  i think all of those should stay  i like those i also enjoyed the boss fights  the main draw for me was interacting with pokémon in the overworld  and they were a fun way of doing that while also showing the destructive might of pokémon  and showing how truly dangerous they were the final thing i really enjoyed was the time the game was set in  learning about pokémon with everyone else  and watching as people are afraid because of how little they understand about pokémon is a really fun thing to experience  i just wish the rest of the game was as good as that ',\n",
